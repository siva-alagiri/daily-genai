      "## 1. OVERVIEW\n",
      "\n",
      "At Acme Corp, consistent and punctual attendance is fundamental to our operational efficiency and team collaboration. Every employee is expected to arrive at their workstation on time, prepared to commence work, and remain for their entire scheduled shift. Unscheduled absences, tardiness, or early departures disrupt workflow and impact team productivity, and as such, must be minimized.\n",
      "\n",
      "This policy outlines the company's expectations regarding attendance and punctuality. It does not supersede or apply to absences covered under specific statutory leaves (e.g., Maternity Benefit Act, Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act) or other company-approved leaves, which are governed by their respective policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. OBJECTIVE\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary objective of this policy is to establish clear guidelines and procedures for managing employee attendance and addressing instances of tardiness or absence. This aims to foster a culture of accountability, ensure optimal staffing levels, enhance overall productivity, and maintain fairness across the organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. ATTENDANCE INFRACTIONS CALCULATION\n",
      "\n",
      "Acme Corp utilizes a point-based system to track attendance infractions. Points accumulate over a defined period and trigger progressive disciplinary actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Absent with prior notification:** 1 Point\n",
      "*   **Absent without prior notification (No-Call, No-Show):** 2 Points\n",
      "*   **Tardy (more than 10 minutes late):** ½ Point\n",
      "*   **Early Departure (more than 10 minutes early):** ½ Point\n",
      "*   **Returning late from scheduled break (over 15 minutes):** 1 Point\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees are granted a 10-minute grace period at the start of their shift. All absences must be reported to the immediate supervisor and/or HR department at least two hours prior to the scheduled start of the shift. Failure to do so will be considered a \"No-Call, No-Show.\" Each day of absence requires separate notification unless a continuous leave has been pre-approved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Employee attendance infraction points are reset every **12 months** from the date of the last infraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. OVERVIEW OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS FOR ATTENDANCE INFRACTIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "Accumulation of attendance infraction points will lead to progressive disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n",

      "*   **3 points:** Verbal Warning\n",
      "*   **4 points:** Written Warning\n",
      "*   **5 points:** Final Written Warning and mandatory meeting with Manager/HR, potentially leading to a 1-day unpaid suspension.\n",
      "*   **6 points:** Review for potential termination of employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "For absences extending three or more consecutive days, employees are required to provide appropriate documentation (e.g., medical certificate from a registered practitioner) upon their return to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "An employee who is a \"No-Call, No-Show\" for three or more consecutive scheduled workdays will be considered to have abandoned their job, leading to immediate termination of employment without further notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees may request exceptions for unforeseen critical circumstances from their manager and HR, which will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. APPROVED UNPAID LEAVES (NON-DISCIPLINARY)\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain approved unpaid absences, while requiring proper procedure and documentation, do not contribute to the attendance infraction point system. These may include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Bereavement leave beyond company-paid provisions.\n",
      "*   Jury duty or court appearances (where not compensated by the state).\n",
      "*   Extended personal emergencies (e.g., critical family illness).\n",
      "*   Specific religious observances not covered by public holidays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Employees must seek prior approval for such leaves whenever possible and provide supporting documentation as required by HR.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. INABILITY TO CLOCK IN OR CLOCK OUT\n",
      "\n",
      "Accurate recording of work hours is mandatory for all employees. Employees are required to clock-in at the start of their shift and clock-out at the end of their shift, as well as for designated breaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the event of a system malfunction or personal inability to clock in or out, employees must immediately notify their direct supervisor and/or HR department. Failure to report such issues promptly or consistent failure to record time accurately may result in disciplinary action.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. EXCEPTIONS TO THE ATTENDANCE POLICY\n",
      "\n",
      "The following types of absences are exempt from the attendance infraction point system, provided they are properly reported and documented:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Approved statutory leaves (e.g., Maternity Leave, Paternity Leave, leave under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act).\n",
      "*   Company-approved paid leaves (e.g., Annual Leave, Sick Leave within policy limits).\n",
      "*   Bereavement leave (as per company policy).\n",
      "*   Jury duty or military service.\n",
      "*   Absences due to work-related injury or illness (covered by ESI/Workmen's Compensation, if applicable).\n",
