## Corporate Email and Digital Communication Policy

**Policy Brief & Purpose**

This Corporate Email and Digital Communication Policy at Acme Corp establishes the guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of all company-provided electronic communication systems, including email, instant messaging, and collaboration platforms. As a leading Information Technology firm, we rely heavily on these tools for internal and external communication. This policy ensures that all digital communications uphold our professional standards, protect sensitive company and client data, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements in India. Our objective is to foster efficient, secure, and ethical communication practices across the organization.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, and any third parties granted access to Acme Corp's digital communication systems and networks, regardless of their location or device used. This includes all company-issued devices and personal devices used to access company resources.

*   Sharing work-related documents and information securely.
*   Participating in approved online training, webinars, and professional development activities.
*   Accessing company-approved applications and services necessary for job functions.
*   Limited personal use that does not interfere with job performance, consume excessive company resources, or violate any other company policies.

**2. Prohibited Use of Corporate Digital Communication**

*   Avoid accessing company systems or sensitive data over unsecured public Wi-Fi networks.

**5. Digital Signature Standards**
All outgoing external emails from company accounts must include a standardized professional signature block, as defined by the Marketing or IT department. This ensures consistent branding and provides essential contact information.
