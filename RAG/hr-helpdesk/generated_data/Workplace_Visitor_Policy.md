# Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp outlines the guidelines for the appropriate, secure, and professional use of corporate email accounts and systems. As email is a primary communication channel and a repository of critical information, this policy aims to safeguard Acme Corp's confidential data, intellectual property, and reputation, while ensuring efficient and compliant communication across our global operations. It reinforces our commitment to data privacy and ethical conduct in line with Indian regulations.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, and any third parties granted access to Acme Corp's email systems, whether through individual accounts or shared departmental mailboxes. Adherence is required regardless of location or device used to access company email.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp's email system is a powerful tool for business communication. While we offer flexibility, all usage must align with our corporate values and legal obligations.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email accounts for all legitimate business purposes, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and internal teams for work-related matters.
*   Accessing and utilizing approved corporate software, platforms, and online services essential for job functions.
*   Official correspondence, project collaboration, and information sharing pertinent to Acme Corp's objectives.
*   Representing Acme Corp professionally in external communications and networking events.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using Acme Corp email, employees are representatives of the company. Therefore, they must strictly avoid:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, defamatory, or illegal under Indian law (e.g., IT Act, 2000).
*   Engaging in unauthorized commercial activities, chain letters, or unsolicited mass emails (spam).
*   Registering for unapproved external services, websites, or subscriptions that could compromise company security or data.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information to unauthorized individuals or entities.
*   Attempting to bypass security measures, access unauthorized accounts, or engage in any form of cyber misconduct.
*   Using email for political lobbying, religious proselytizing, or any activities unrelated to Acme Corp's business.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all email communications and activity on its systems to ensure compliance with this policy and protect its assets.

**Personal Use**

Limited and reasonable personal use of company email is permitted, provided it does not:

*   Interfere with job performance or productivity.
*   Consume excessive network resources or storage.
*   Violate any other company policies, including those on confidentiality, data security, or acceptable use.
*   Involve illegal, unethical, or inappropriate content.

Employees should exercise discretion and remember that all communications on company systems are subject to monitoring and are considered company property.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for cyber threats. Employees are critical to maintaining email security and must:

*   Create and maintain strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, adhering to Acme Corp's password policy (e.g., minimum length, complexity, regular changes).
*   Never share their email passwords with anyone, including IT personnel.
*   Be vigilant against phishing attempts, suspicious links, and unsolicited attachments. Always verify the sender and content before clicking or downloading.
*   Report any suspicious emails, security incidents, or potential breaches immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Ensure all devices used to access company email are protected with up-to-date antivirus software and security patches.
*   Encrypt sensitive data when transmitting via email, as per company data protection guidelines.

*   Company Address

Employees should consult the Marketing or IT department for the official signature template and guidance on its implementation. Unauthorized images, quotes, or personal links are generally prohibited.
