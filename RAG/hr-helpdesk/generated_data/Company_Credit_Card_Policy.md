*   Engaging in activities that violate any local, national, or international laws or regulations.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all corporate email communications for compliance with this policy and for security purposes.

**Personal Use**

Limited and reasonable personal use of corporate email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job performance, consume excessive company resources, or violate any other company policies. Examples of acceptable personal use include:

*   Registering for professional development courses or industry events.
*   Sending brief, non-urgent communications to friends and family.
*   Subscribing to newsletters or downloading content for personal growth, provided it is safe and appropriate.

Employees must ensure that personal use never compromises the security or confidentiality of company data.

**Email Security**

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Protecting Acme Corp's email infrastructure and data is paramount. Employees must:

*   Create and maintain strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, adhering to Acme Corp's password policy (minimum eight characters, combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols, avoiding personal information).
*   Enable and utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) where required.
*   Change email passwords regularly as mandated by IT security protocols.
*   Exercise extreme caution with suspicious emails:
    *   Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or untrusted senders.
    *   Be wary of urgent or enticing subject lines (clickbait).
    *   Verify the sender's email address and name for legitimacy, looking for subtle misspellings or inconsistencies.
    *   Report any suspicious emails immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Keep anti-malware and antivirus software on company-issued devices updated.
