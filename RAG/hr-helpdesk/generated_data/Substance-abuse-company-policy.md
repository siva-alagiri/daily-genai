# Acme Corp Email Usage Policy

## POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE

This Acme Corp Email Usage Policy establishes the guidelines for the appropriate, secure, and professional use of the company's electronic mail system. As a leading Information Technology firm, our email infrastructure is a critical asset for communication, collaboration, and data exchange. This policy aims to safeguard our proprietary information, maintain our professional reputation, ensure compliance with data protection standards, and foster an efficient and respectful digital environment for all users.

## SCOPE

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, and any third-party personnel granted access to or utilizing Acme Corp's email systems, whether assigned individually or to a department. This includes all email accounts, servers, and related services provided by Acme Corp, regardless of the device or network used to access them.

## COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY

Acme Corp's email system is a powerful tool designed to facilitate business operations. While we offer a degree of flexibility, all usage must align with our organizational values and operational security.

### Correct Use of Corporate Email

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email accounts for all work-related activities without undue restriction. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and colleagues.
*   Accessing and utilizing approved software and online services essential for job functions.
*   Exchanging professional information at conferences, industry events, or career fairs.
*   Subscribing to professional newsletters, industry updates, or platforms that support professional development and job performance.

### Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email

When using an Acme Corp email address, individuals represent the company. Therefore, users must strictly avoid:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is insulting, discriminatory, harassing, or offensive to any individual or group.
*   Registering for or accessing services that are directly competitive with Acme Corp's business, unless explicitly authorized by senior management.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspicious, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Distributing unlawful marketing materials, chain letters, or solicitations.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information without proper authorization.

### Personal Use

Limited and reasonable personal use of corporate email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job duties, consume excessive company resources, or violate any other aspect of this policy. Acceptable personal use may include:

*   Registering for educational courses or professional networking events.
*   Brief communications with friends and family, ensuring no confidential company information is disclosed and no spamming occurs.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate guides, e-books, or content for personal interest that does not pose a security risk.

### Email Security

Email remains a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Protecting our email system is crucial for maintaining Acme Corp's reputation, legal standing, and the security of our technological infrastructure. All users must:

*   Establish strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, comprising a minimum of twelve characters with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, avoiding personal information.
*   Change email passwords every 90 days.
*   Be vigilant against suspicious emails. Users are instructed to:
    *   Never open attachments or click on links from unknown or unverified senders.
    *   Exercise caution with emails featuring sensational or urgent subject lines (clickbait).
    *   Verify the sender's name and email address for legitimacy, especially for requests involving sensitive information.
    *   Look for stylistic inconsistencies, grammatical errors, or excessive punctuation, which are common red flags.
*   Report any perceived security threats, suspicious emails, or phishing attempts immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Ensure that any anti-malware or security software on devices used to access company email is kept up-to-date.

### Email Signature

Employees are encouraged to maintain a professional and consistent email signature that accurately reflects their role and Acme Corp's brand. The standard format should include:

*   Employee's Full Name
*   Job Title, Department
*   Acme Corp [with company website link]
*   Company Phone Number (optional)
*   Company Address (optional)

Inclusion of company logos, work-related videos, or links is permitted, provided they adhere to brand guidelines. Assistance with signature setup can be obtained from the IT Helpdesk or direct supervisor.

## DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES
