## Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This policy establishes the guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of Acme Corp's email systems and services. Its primary objective is to ensure that all electronic communications uphold professional standards, protect sensitive company information, maintain the integrity of our digital infrastructure, and comply with all relevant data protection laws and internal policies. By defining acceptable practices, we aim to foster efficient communication while mitigating risks associated with misuse or security breaches.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all individuals who are granted access to or use Acme Corp's email systems, including but not limited to permanent employees, contract staff, temporary workers, consultants, and third-party vendors. This encompasses all company-issued email addresses, whether accessed from company-owned or personal devices, and regardless of physical location.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp's email system is a vital communication tool provided for business-related activities. While a degree of personal use is permitted, all users must understand and adhere to the following principles.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email accounts for all legitimate business purposes, including:
- Communicating with colleagues, clients, partners, and stakeholders for work-related matters.
- Accessing and utilizing company-approved software and online services necessary for job functions.
- Participating in professional development, training, and industry-related forums that benefit the company or individual growth.
- Sharing official company announcements, reports, and project updates.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using an Acme Corp email address, employees represent the organization. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:
- Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, defamatory, or illegal.
- Registering for or subscribing to services that are unauthorized, unreliable, illegal, or competitive with Acme Corp's business interests.
- Engaging in unsolicited mass emailing (spamming) or chain letters.
- Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company, client, or employee information without explicit authorization.
- Attempting to bypass security measures or access unauthorized systems.
- Using email for personal financial gain, political campaigning, or any activity that could be perceived as endorsing non-company entities.

**Personal Use**

Limited and reasonable personal use of company email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job duties, consume excessive company resources, or violate any other company policies. Examples of acceptable personal use include:
- Brief communications with family or friends during non-working hours or breaks.
- Registering for personal online services or newsletters that do not conflict with company interests.
- Managing personal appointments or non-work-related logistics, as long as it is infrequent and does not impact productivity.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for cyber threats. All employees must exercise vigilance to protect company data and systems. Employees are required to:
- Create and maintain strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, adhering to Acme Corp's password policy (e.g., minimum length, complexity, regular changes).
- Be highly suspicious of unsolicited emails, attachments, or links, especially those with unusual senders, generic greetings, or urgent requests.
- Report any suspicious emails, phishing attempts, or security incidents immediately to the IT Security team.
- Never share email account credentials with anyone.
- Ensure that any company data accessed via email on personal devices is protected according to Acme Corp's data protection and cybersecurity policies.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to use a professional and standardized email signature for all external communications. The signature should reflect Acme Corp's branding guidelines and typically include:
- Employee's Full Name
- Job Title
- Department
- Company Name (Acme Corp)
- Company Website Link
- Official Company Phone Number (optional)
- Company Address (optional)
Employees should consult their department head or the Marketing team for specific signature templates and guidelines. Images, logos, or links in signatures must be company-approved.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Any violation of this Email Usage Policy will be taken seriously and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, in accordance with Acme Corp's Disciplinary Policy. The severity of the consequence will depend on the nature and impact of the violation. Examples of actions that may lead to disciplinary measures include:
- Unauthorized disclosure of confidential company information.
- Repeated or severe inappropriate use of email.
- Engaging in illegal activities via company email.
