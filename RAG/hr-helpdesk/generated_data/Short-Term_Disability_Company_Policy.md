# Company Cyber Security Policy

**Policy Brief & Purpose**

At Acme Corp, we recognize that our data and technological infrastructure are critical assets. This Cyber Security Policy outlines the essential guidelines and protective measures for safeguarding our digital environment. As an Information Technology company with a global presence, we are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information systems and data against evolving cyber threats, human error, and system vulnerabilities. This policy ensures that all individuals interacting with our systems understand their role in upholding our security posture.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, and any third-party personnel who have access to Acme Corp's information systems, networks, devices, or data, regardless of their location or the device used (company-issued or personal).

**Policy Elements**

**Confidential Data**

Confidential data at Acme Corp is defined as any information that is not publicly available and whose unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction could cause harm to the company, its clients, or its employees. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Proprietary software code, algorithms, and intellectual property.
*   Client data, personal identifiable information (PII), and sensitive business records.
*   Unpublished financial results, strategic plans, and merger/acquisition information.
*   Employee personal data and human resources records.
*   Security protocols, network configurations, and system vulnerabilities.

All individuals are obligated to protect this data diligently.

**Protect Personal and Company Devices**

Devices used to access Acme Corp resources, whether company-issued or personal (under BYOD policy), must adhere to strict security standards. Users are required to:

*   Ensure all devices are protected with strong, unique passwords or biometric authentication.
*   Install and regularly update approved antivirus and anti-malware software.
*   Keep operating systems, applications, and browsers updated with the latest security patches.
*   Never leave devices unattended or unsecured in public or shared spaces.
*   Access company accounts and systems exclusively through secure, encrypted networks. Public Wi-Fi should only be used with an approved Virtual Private Network (VPN).
*   Report any lost or stolen devices immediately to the IT Security team.

**Keep Emails Safe**

Email remains a primary vector for cyberattacks. To prevent phishing, malware, and data breaches, employees must:

*   Exercise extreme caution with unsolicited emails, especially those containing attachments or links. Do not open them if the sender is unknown or the content seems suspicious.
*   Be wary of emails requesting personal or login information, even if they appear to be from internal sources. Always verify the sender and context.
*   Report any suspicious emails to the IT Security team immediately using the designated reporting mechanism.
*   Look for red flags such as grammatical errors, unusual sender addresses, or urgent/threatening language.

**Manage Passwords Properly**

Robust password management is fundamental to our security. Employees must:

*   Create strong, complex passwords of at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
*   Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdays, names, or common words.
*   Never share passwords with anyone, including colleagues or IT support.
*   Utilize Acme Corp's approved password manager for storing and generating secure passwords.
*   Change passwords for critical systems every 90 days or as prompted by system policies.

**Transfer Data Securely**

The secure transfer of data is paramount to prevent unauthorized access. Employees must:

*   Only transfer sensitive or confidential data over Acme Corp's secure internal network or approved encrypted channels.
*   Avoid using public cloud storage, personal email, or unencrypted external drives for company data unless explicitly authorized and secured.
*   Verify the identity and authorization of recipients before sharing any confidential information.
*   Consult the IT Security team for guidance on transferring large volumes of sensitive data.

**Report Scams, Privacy Breaches and Hacking Attempts**

Prompt reporting is crucial for effective incident response. Employees are required to:

*   Immediately report any suspected security incidents, including phishing attempts, malware infections, unauthorized access, or data breaches, to the IT Security Operations Center (SOC) or designated IT Security contact.
*   Provide all available details regarding the incident to assist with investigation and containment.
*   Understand that timely reporting helps protect the entire organization.

**Additional Measures**

Acme Corp implements and expects adherence to the following:

*   **Physical Security:** Always lock your workstation when stepping away. Secure physical documents containing confidential information.
*   **Software Usage:** Only install company-approved and licensed software on company devices. Unauthorized software can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **Web Browsing:** Avoid accessing suspicious or unapproved websites that could host malware or compromise device security.
*   **Stolen Equipment:** Report stolen or damaged company equipment to IT Security and HR immediately. All associated account passwords must be changed.
*   **Security Team Role:** Our dedicated IT Security team is responsible for deploying firewalls, intrusion detection systems, access controls, and conducting regular security audits. They also provide ongoing training and alerts on emerging threats.

**Remote Employees**

Remote employees are an integral part of Acme Corp and must adhere to all aspects of this policy. Special attention should be paid to:

*   Ensuring home networks are secured with strong Wi-Fi passwords and up-to-date router firmware.
*   Maintaining a dedicated and private workspace to prevent unauthorized viewing of sensitive information.
*   Using company-provided VPN for all access to internal resources.
*   Reporting any unusual network activity or device behavior immediately.

**Disciplinary Action**

Acme Corp takes cyber security seriously. Violations of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, and potential legal action, depending on the severity and intent of the breach.

*   **First-time, unintentional, minor breach:** May result in a verbal warning, mandatory retraining, and closer monitoring.
*   **Repeated or intentional breaches, or those causing significant financial or reputational damage:** Will lead to severe disciplinary measures, including suspension, demotion, or immediate termination.

Any employee found to be deliberately circumventing security controls or engaging in malicious activity will face immediate termination and potential legal prosecution.

**Take Security Seriously**

Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. Every individual at Acme Corp plays a vital role in protecting our collective digital assets. By remaining vigilant and adhering to these guidelines, we ensure a secure and trustworthy environment for our employees, clients, and partners. We encourage all employees to actively participate in security awareness training and to report any concerns or suggestions to the IT Security team.
