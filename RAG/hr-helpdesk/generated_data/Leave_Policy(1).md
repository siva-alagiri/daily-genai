## Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This policy at Acme Corp outlines the responsible and secure use of corporate email accounts. As a leading Information Technology firm, digital communication is fundamental to our operations and client interactions. This policy ensures that all email usage upholds our professional standards, safeguards sensitive company and client data, and protects our digital infrastructure and reputation.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties granted access to Acme Corp's email systems, whether individual or departmental accounts. It covers all devices used to access company email, regardless of location.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp's email system is a critical asset for business communication and collaboration. Its primary purpose is for official company business. While limited personal use is permitted, all users must adhere to the guidelines below to ensure appropriate and secure conduct.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Acme Corp employees are authorized to use their corporate email for legitimate business activities, including but not limited to:

*   Engaging with clients, partners, and stakeholders.
*   Accessing approved business applications and services.
*   Networking at industry events and professional gatherings.
*   Subscribing to professional development resources relevant to their role.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using Acme Corp email, users represent the company. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is offensive, discriminatory, harassing, or defamatory.
*   Registering for services or platforms that are unauthorized, illegal, or pose a security risk.
*   Engaging in unsolicited mass emailing (spam) or chain letters.
*   Disclosing confidential company, client, or proprietary information.
*   Participating in activities that violate intellectual property rights or legal statutes.
*   Using email for personal financial gain or outside business ventures without explicit approval.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all email communications on its systems.

**Personal Use**

Limited and reasonable personal use of corporate email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job duties, violate company policies, or compromise security. Examples include:

*   Registering for professional development courses or relevant community events.
*   Brief communications with family or friends that do not contain sensitive information or constitute spam.
*   Accessing safe and appropriate online content for personal growth, ensuring no impact on network performance or security.

**Email Security**

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats. Protecting our email system is paramount to prevent data breaches, malware infections, and reputational damage. All users must:

*   Create robust passwords (minimum 12 characters, combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) and avoid using easily guessable personal information.
*   Never share passwords or write them down in an insecure location.
*   Update passwords every 90 days.
*   Exercise extreme caution with suspicious emails:
    *   Do not open unexpected attachments or click on unfamiliar links.
    *   Be wary of urgent or enticing subject lines (e.g., 'clickbait').
    *   Verify sender identity, especially for requests for sensitive information.
    *   Look for grammatical errors, unusual formatting, or inconsistencies.
*   Report any suspected phishing attempts or security concerns immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Ensure all company-issued devices used for email access have up-to-date anti-malware and security software.

**Email Signature**

A standardized, professional email signature is required for all outgoing business communications to maintain brand consistency and professionalism. The signature should include:

*   [Employee Name]
*   [Employee Title], Acme Corp
*   [Contact Number]
*   [Company Website]
*   [Company Address]

Only company-approved logos or links to official company content are permitted. Employees can consult their department head or the Marketing team for guidance on signature setup.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Failure to comply with this Email Usage Policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Examples of severe violations include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential company or client data.
*   Sending or receiving emails containing illegal, harassing, or offensive content.
*   Engaging in fraudulent or unlawful activities using company email.
*   Repeated security breaches due to negligence.
