## Acme Corp Email Usage Policy

### POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE

This Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp outlines the expectations and guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of corporate email accounts by all personnel. As a leading Information Technology company, email is a critical communication tool and a repository of sensitive information. This policy is designed to ensure professional conduct, safeguard company data, protect our reputation, and maintain compliance with relevant Indian laws and data protection standards.

### SCOPE

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email systems, whether individually or as part of a department. This includes access from company-issued devices or personal devices used for work purposes.

### COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY

Corporate email accounts are provided to facilitate business operations and professional communication. While a degree of personal use is permitted, all activities must align with Acme Corp’s values and security protocols.

#### Correct Use of Corporate Email

Acme Corp employees are authorized to use their company email for all legitimate work-related activities, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and internal teams.
*   Accessing and registering for business-critical software, platforms, and services.
*   Participating in professional development, webinars, and industry-related forums.
*   Networking at conferences and corporate events for business development.

#### Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email

When using an Acme Corp email address, individuals represent the company. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or defamatory.
*   Registering for or accessing websites or services that are illegal, unreliable, or pose a security risk.
*   Engaging in unauthorized mass mailings, spamming, or chain letters.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information without explicit authorization.
*   Using email for personal financial gain, political lobbying, or any activity that conflicts with company interests.
*   Impersonating another individual or entity.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all corporate email communications for compliance with this policy and to protect its assets and reputation.

#### Personal Use

Limited personal use of corporate email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with work duties, compromise company security, or violate any other company policies. Acceptable personal use examples include:

*   Registering for educational courses or professional networking events.
*   Sending brief, non-disruptive communications to friends or family.
*   Subscribing to safe and appropriate newsletters or content for personal growth.

Personal use must never involve the transmission of confidential company data or engage in activities that could reflect negatively on Acme Corp.

#### Email Security

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. All users must adhere to stringent security practices:

*   **Password Management:** Create strong, unique passwords (minimum 12 characters, combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) and change them every 90 days. Never write down or share passwords.
*   **Phishing Awareness:** Exercise extreme caution with suspicious emails. Do not open attachments or click links from unknown senders or if the content seems unusual, even from known contacts.
*   **Verification:** Always verify the sender's identity and the legitimacy of requests, especially those involving financial transactions or sensitive data.
*   **Reporting:** Immediately report any suspicious emails, security incidents, or potential breaches to the IT Security team.
*   **Software Updates:** Ensure all anti-malware and security software on devices used to access company email is up-to-date.

#### Email Signature

A consistent and professional email signature reinforces Acme Corp’s brand identity. All outgoing business emails must include a standardized signature:

**[Your Full Name]**
**[Your Job Title]**
**Acme Corp**
**[Your Phone Number (Optional)] | [Company Website Link]**
**[Company Address]**

Images, company logos, or links to work-related content may be included as per IT guidelines. For assistance with signature setup, contact the IT Helpdesk.

### DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES

Any violation of this Email Usage Policy will be taken seriously and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment, legal action, and reporting to relevant authorities, depending on the severity and impact of the breach. Examples of violations that may lead to termination include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential company, client, or partner information.
*   Sending or receiving illegal, offensive, or discriminatory content.
*   Using corporate email for fraudulent activities.
*   Repeated failure to adhere to email security protocols after warnings.

Each incident will be investigated thoroughly and handled on a case-by-case basis by Human Resources and relevant management.
