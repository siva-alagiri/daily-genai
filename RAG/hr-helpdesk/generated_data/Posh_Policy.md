**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp outlines the expectations and guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of corporate email accounts by all personnel. As a leading Information Technology company, email is a fundamental communication channel and a repository of critical information. This policy is designed to safeguard Acme Corp's intellectual property, maintain data integrity, protect against cyber threats, and uphold our professional reputation in the market. It ensures that email communications align with our corporate values, legal obligations, and security standards.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, and any third parties who are granted access to or use Acme Corp's email systems, whether individually assigned or departmental. This includes access from company-issued devices or personal devices used for work purposes.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Acme Corp's email system is provided as a primary tool for business communication and collaboration. Employees are authorized to use their corporate email for:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and internal teams regarding company projects and operations.
*   Accessing and utilizing authorized software, platforms, and cloud services essential for job functions.
*   Professional networking and information exchange at industry events, conferences, or for career development relevant to Acme Corp.
*   Receiving official company communications, updates, and alerts.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using corporate email, all individuals represent Acme Corp. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, defamatory, or violates any company policies (e.g., Anti-discrimination, Anti-harassment).
*   Registering for unauthorized competitive services, personal financial accounts, or non-work-related online platforms that could compromise company security or reputation.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited mass emails (spam) or engaging in phishing activities.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information (e.g., client data, project plans, source code) to unauthorized recipients.
*   Engaging in any illegal activities or promoting unlawful content.
*   Using email for excessive personal use that interferes with job performance or consumes significant company resources.

**Personal Use**

Acme Corp acknowledges that occasional personal use of corporate email may occur. Such use must be minimal, not interfere with work duties, and adhere to all policy guidelines. Permitted personal use includes:

*   Registering for professional development courses or industry events that may benefit personal growth.
*   Brief communications with family or friends, provided no confidential information is shared and it does not disrupt work.
*   Subscribing to newsletters or downloading safe, appropriate content for personal interest, as long as it does not pose a security risk or violate company policies.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for cyberattacks, including malware, phishing, and data breaches. Protecting our email system is paramount to maintaining our operational integrity and data security. All users must:

*   Maintain strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, adhering to Acme Corp's password policy (e.g., minimum length, complexity, regular changes).
*   Enable and utilize multi-factor authentication (MFA) where required.
*   Exercise extreme caution with suspicious emails:
    *   Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or untrusted senders.
    *   Verify the sender's identity and legitimacy, especially for unexpected requests or urgent messages.
    *   Look for red flags such as grammatical errors, unusual formatting, or requests for personal/confidential information.
*   Report any suspicious emails, phishing attempts, or security incidents immediately to the Security Operations Center (SOC) or IT Helpdesk.
*   Ensure that company-issued devices used for email access are protected with up-to-date antivirus software and security patches.
*   Comply with all data protection and privacy regulations, including India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP Act), when handling personal data via email.
