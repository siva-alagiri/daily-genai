## Company Email Communication Policy

### POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE

This Email Communication Policy at Acme Corp establishes the guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of company-provided email accounts. As a critical business communication tool, email facilitates internal and external interactions. This policy aims to safeguard Acme Corp's sensitive information, uphold its professional reputation, and ensure compliance with data protection standards and legal obligations within the Indian context.

### SCOPE

This policy applies to all permanent, temporary, and contract employees, as well as consultants and any third-party personnel granted access to Acme Corp's email systems or accounts, whether individual or departmental. Adherence is required regardless of location or device used to access company email.

### COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY

Acme Corp's email system is provided primarily for business-related communications and activities. While a degree of personal use is permitted, all users must prioritize business objectives and maintain professional conduct at all times.

**Acceptable Use**

Employees are authorized to use their company email for purposes directly related to their job functions and Acme Corp's business operations. This includes:

*   Engaging in professional correspondence with clients, partners, and stakeholders.
*   Facilitating internal team collaboration and project communication.
*   Registering for industry-relevant webinars, training programs, or professional development platforms.
*   Accessing company-approved software and services essential for job functions.
*   Representing Acme Corp at official events or for business networking.

**Prohibited Use**

When using company email, employees are strictly prohibited from:

*   Transmitting or storing any content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or illegal under Indian law.
*   Registering for or accessing services of direct competitors without explicit management approval.
*   Sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) or engaging in chain letters.
*   Subscribing to or interacting with websites or services that are unreliable, illegal, or pose security risks.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information to unauthorized parties.
*   Engaging in political lobbying or commercial activities unrelated to Acme Corp's business.
*   Impersonating another individual or misrepresenting one's identity.

**Personal Use**

Limited and occasional personal use of company email is permitted, provided it:

*   Does not interfere with work duties or productivity.
*   Does not violate any other company policy, including those on confidentiality and data security.
*   Does not consume excessive company resources (e.g., large attachments, excessive storage).
*   Does not create any legal or security risks for Acme Corp.
*   Examples include brief communications with family/friends or registration for personal development courses.

**Email Security**

Email is a frequent target for cyber threats. All employees must adhere to the following security protocols:

*   **Password Management:** Use strong, unique passwords (minimum 12 characters, combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) and change them every 90 days. Never share passwords or write them down in an accessible location.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Exercise extreme caution with suspicious emails. Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown senders or if the content seems unusual, even from known contacts. Verify sender identity and look for grammatical errors or unusual formatting.
*   **Reporting Suspicions:** Immediately report any suspected phishing attempts, malware, or security vulnerabilities to the IT Security team.
*   **Device Security:** Ensure all devices used to access company email are protected with up-to-date antivirus software, firewalls, and operating system security patches.
*   **Data Handling:** Avoid sending sensitive or confidential company data via unencrypted email. Use approved secure file transfer methods where necessary.

**Email Signature**

All official Acme Corp emails must include a standardized signature block to maintain a consistent professional image. This typically includes:

*   [Your Name]
*   [Your Title]
*   Acme Corp
*   [Company Website]
*   [Company Phone Number (optional)]

No personal quotes, external links, or non-company-approved images should be included in the signature. Employees can consult the Marketing or IT department for guidance on setting up their official signature.

### DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES

Non-compliance with this Email Communication Policy will result in disciplinary action, which may range from formal warnings and suspension to immediate termination of employment, depending on the severity and frequency of the violation. Serious breaches, such as unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, engaging in illegal activities, or causing significant reputational damage to Acme Corp, will lead to severe penalties, including potential legal action in accordance with Indian laws.
