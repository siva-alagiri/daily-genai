## Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

At Acme Corp, our corporate email system is a vital communication channel for business operations. This policy establishes clear guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of company email accounts. Its purpose is to ensure the integrity of our data, safeguard our intellectual property, maintain our professional reputation, and comply with all relevant legal and regulatory standards applicable in India.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties granted access to or assigned an Acme Corp email address, whether individual or departmental. This includes all email accounts, systems, and associated data, regardless of the device used for access or the location from which it is accessed.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp's email system is provided primarily for business-related communications and activities. While a degree of personal use is permitted, all users must adhere to the principles of professionalism, security, and data protection. This section details the acceptable and unacceptable uses of corporate email.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email accounts for all legitimate business purposes, including but not limited to:
- Communicating with clients, partners, and internal teams regarding company projects and operations.
- Accessing and utilizing company-approved software, platforms, and services necessary for job functions.
- Representing Acme Corp professionally at industry events, conferences, and networking opportunities.
- Subscribing to professional development resources, industry news, and technical forums that enhance job-related skills and knowledge.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

As corporate email reflects on Acme Corp's image and security, employees must refrain from:
- Sending, forwarding, or storing content that is offensive, discriminatory, harassing, or sexually explicit.
- Registering for or accessing services, particularly those of competitors, without explicit authorization from management.
- Engaging in unsolicited mass emailing (spamming) or chain letters, whether internal or external.
- Subscribing to or interacting with websites, services, or platforms that are illegal, unreliable, or pose a security risk.
- Distributing unauthorized marketing materials, solicitations, or political endorsements.
- Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information to unauthorized individuals or entities.
Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all email communications and usage for compliance with this policy and legal obligations.

**Personal Use**

Limited and reasonable personal use of Acme Corp email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job duties, violate company policies, or compromise security. Acceptable personal use includes:
- Brief communications with family or friends during non-working hours.
- Registering for personal development courses, webinars, or professional networking events.
- Accessing safe and appropriate online content for personal growth, provided it does not consume excessive bandwidth or storage.
Users must ensure that personal communications do not contain confidential company information or reflect negatively on Acme Corp.

**Email Security**

Email remains a primary vector for cyber threats, including phishing, malware, and data breaches. Protecting Acme Corp's digital assets and reputation is paramount. All employees must:
- **Password Management:** Create and maintain strong, unique passwords for all company accounts, adhering to Acme Corp's password policy (e.g., minimum 12 characters, mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols). Passwords should never be shared or written down in an unsecured location. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be enabled where available.
- **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Exercise extreme caution with suspicious emails. Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown senders or if the content seems unusual, even from known contacts. Verify sender identity for unexpected requests, especially those involving financial transactions or sensitive data.
- **Reporting Suspicious Activity:** Immediately report any suspected phishing attempts, unusual email behavior, or security incidents to the IT Security team.
- **Software Updates:** Ensure all operating systems, email clients, and security software on company-issued devices are kept up-to-date.
- **Data Handling:** Avoid sending sensitive, confidential, or proprietary company information via unencrypted email, especially to external recipients. Use approved secure file transfer methods when necessary.

**Email Signature**

To maintain a consistent and professional brand image, all outgoing emails from Acme Corp accounts must include a standardized signature. Employees are required to use the official signature template provided by the Marketing or IT department. This template typically includes:
- Employee's Full Name
- Job Title
- Acme Corp Name and Website Link
- Official Company Phone Number (if applicable)
- Company Address
Customization with personal quotes, unapproved images, or external links is generally prohibited to ensure uniformity and compliance. Employees should consult their manager or the IT department for assistance with signature setup.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Adherence to this Email Usage Policy is mandatory for all users. Violations, depending on their severity and frequency, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, and potential legal action. Examples of serious violations include:
- Unauthorized disclosure or transmission of confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company data.
- Engaging in illegal activities or promoting unlawful content via company email.
- Persistent sending of harassing, discriminatory, or offensive communications.
- Repeated disregard for security protocols, leading to system vulnerabilities or breaches.
All incidents will be investigated thoroughly and handled in accordance with Acme Corp's disciplinary procedures.
