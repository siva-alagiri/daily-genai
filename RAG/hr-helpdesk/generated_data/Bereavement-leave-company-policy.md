*   **Reporting Suspicious Activity:** Immediately report any suspected phishing attempts, malware, or unauthorized access to the IT Security team.
*   **Data Handling:** Exercise caution when sending sensitive information. Ensure recipients are authorized and consider alternative secure methods for highly confidential data.
*   **Device Security:** Ensure all devices used to access company email are protected with up-to-date antivirus software, firewalls, and operating system security patches.
