# Company Cyber Security Policy

This Company Cyber Security Policy outlines Acme Corp's guidelines and provisions for safeguarding our digital assets and technology infrastructure.

**Policy brief & purpose**

At Acme Corp, our reliance on technology to innovate, develop, and deliver cutting-edge IT solutions means that protecting our data and systems is paramount. This policy establishes the framework for preserving the security and integrity of our information and technology assets against evolving cyber threats. Human errors, sophisticated attacks, and system vulnerabilities pose significant risks to our operations, client trust, and reputation. Therefore, we have implemented robust security measures and clear instructions to mitigate these risks, ensuring a secure and resilient environment for all.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties who are granted permanent or temporary access to our systems, networks, devices, or data, regardless of their location or role.

**Policy elements**

**Confidential data**

Confidential data at Acme Corp is proprietary, valuable, and often subject to strict regulatory compliance. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Proprietary source code, algorithms, and unreleased product specifications
*   Client data, intellectual property, and contractual agreements
*   Internal financial records, strategic plans, and business development information
*   Employee personal data and HR records
*   Any information explicitly marked as confidential or proprietary

All individuals covered by this policy are obligated to protect this data diligently.

**Protect personal and company devices**

Devices used to access Acme Corp's resources, whether company-issued or personal (under BYOD policy), introduce potential security risks. All users must ensure their devices (laptops, desktops, tablets, mobile phones) are secure by:

*   Maintaining strong, unique passwords or biometric authentication for all devices.
*   Installing and regularly updating approved antivirus and anti-malware software.
*   Ensuring devices are never left unattended or unsecured in public or shared spaces.
*   Applying security updates for operating systems and applications promptly.
*   Accessing company accounts and systems exclusively through secure, private networks, utilizing Acme Corp's Virtual Private Network (VPN) when connecting from external locations.
*   Following specific instructions from the IT Security team for disk encryption, multi-factor authentication setup, and password management tools upon onboarding.

Lending company-issued devices to unauthorized individuals or using personal devices for company access without IT approval is strictly prohibited.

**Keep emails safe**

Emails are a primary vector for cyber threats like phishing, malware, and ransomware. To prevent infections and data breaches, employees must:

*   Exercise extreme caution with unsolicited emails, especially those containing attachments or links. Do not open them if the content is vague, unexpected, or from an unknown sender.
*   Be wary of suspicious subject lines, urgent requests, or offers that seem too good to be true.
*   Always verify the sender's email address and name for legitimacy, looking for subtle misspellings or inconsistencies.
*   Report any suspected phishing attempts or malicious emails to the IT Security team immediately.
*   Never share login credentials or sensitive information via email.

**Manage passwords properly**

Effective password management is critical to preventing unauthorized access. All users are required to:

*   Create strong, complex passwords of at least 12 characters, incorporating a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information or easily guessable sequences.
*   Utilize Acme Corp's approved password manager to generate and securely store unique passwords for different accounts.
*   Never write down passwords or share them with anyone, including colleagues or IT support, unless explicitly instructed by IT Security for a specific, secure process.
*   Change passwords for critical systems every 90 days.
*   Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever available and mandated by IT Security.

**Transfer data securely**

Secure data transfer is essential to protect sensitive information. Employees must:

*   Avoid transferring confidential or sensitive data (e.g., client lists, unreleased code) to personal devices, external storage, or unauthorized cloud services unless absolutely necessary and approved by management and IT Security.
*   Utilize only Acme Corp's secure internal network, encrypted channels, or approved cloud storage solutions for sharing sensitive information. Public Wi-Fi networks should never be used for transferring confidential data without an active VPN connection.
*   Ensure that all recipients of data are authorized individuals or entities with appropriate security protocols in place.

**Report scams, privacy breaches and hacking attempts**

Prompt reporting of security incidents is vital for effective response and mitigation. Employees must report any perceived cyberattacks, suspicious activities, privacy breaches, or potential security weaknesses in Acme Corp's systems to the IT Security team immediately. The IT Security team will investigate all reports promptly, resolve issues, and issue company-wide alerts when necessary. Employees are encouraged to consult IT Security for any questions or concerns regarding potential threats.

**Additional measures**

To further enhance our cyber security posture, all employees are expected to:

*   Lock their computer screens and secure their devices when stepping away from their workstations.
*   Report lost or stolen company equipment (laptops, mobile phones) to HR and IT Security within one hour of discovery.
*   Change all account passwords immediately if a device used for company access is lost or stolen.
*   Refrain from downloading or installing unauthorized, suspicious, or illegal software on company-issued devices.
*   Avoid accessing suspicious or unverified websites, especially those that trigger security warnings.
*   Adhere to a clean desk policy, ensuring sensitive physical documents are secured when not in use.

**Remote employees**

Remote employees are integral to Acme Corp's operations and must adhere to all aspects of this policy. Specific considerations for remote work include:

*   Ensuring their home network is secured with a strong password and firewall.
*   Always using Acme Corp's VPN for accessing company resources.
*   Maintaining physical security of company-issued devices in their remote workspace.
*   Reporting any suspicious network activity or unauthorized access attempts on their home network that could impact company data.
*   Seeking guidance from the IT Security team for any remote work security concerns.

**Disciplinary Action**

Acme Corp expects strict adherence to this policy. Violations will be taken seriously and may result in disciplinary action:

*   **First-time, unintentional, small-scale security breach:** May result in a verbal warning, mandatory re-training on cyber security protocols, and close monitoring.
*   **Intentional, repeated, or large-scale breaches (causing significant financial, reputational, or operational damage):** Will lead to severe disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment. Legal action may also be pursued where applicable.

Employees who consistently disregard security instructions, even if no breach occurs, will face progressive discipline. Each incident will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by HR and IT Security.

**Take security seriously**

The collective security of Acme Corp relies on the vigilance and responsible actions of every individual. By prioritizing cyber security, we protect our clients, our intellectual property, and our shared future. We encourage everyone to remain proactive, report concerns, and contribute to a culture of robust digital safety.
