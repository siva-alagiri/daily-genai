## Flexible Work Model Policy

**Acme Corp**

### Overview and Purpose

At Acme Corp, a leading Information Technology company with over 10,000 employees, we are committed to fostering a dynamic and supportive work environment that empowers our talent to thrive. This Flexible Work Model Policy outlines our approach to hybrid work, designed to balance individual flexibility with organizational needs for collaboration, innovation, and sustained productivity. We believe that offering adaptable work arrangements enhances employee well-being, attracts top talent, and strengthens our position as an industry leader in India and globally.

### Policy Framework

#### Introduction to the Flexible Work Model

Acme Corp recognizes the evolving landscape of modern work. Our "AcmeFlex" program is a strategic initiative that provides eligible employees with options for where and how they perform their duties, promoting a harmonious integration of professional and personal life while maintaining our high standards of operational excellence.

#### Policy Objectives

*   To enhance organizational resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing business environment.
*   To support our goals in attracting, retaining, and developing a diverse and highly skilled workforce.
*   To contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing commuting impact.
*   To promote a healthy work-life integration and overall employee satisfaction across our 10,000-strong team.

### Hybrid Working Categories

Acme Corp acknowledges that different roles and individual circumstances may require varied approaches to hybrid work. The following categories define our flexible work models:

*   **Remote-Focused:** Roles primarily performed away from the physical office, with on-site presence required only for specific tasks, team meetings, or critical events that necessitate physical attendance.
*   **Office-Intermittent:** Employees in this category primarily work remotely but are expected to be present in the office on a regular, pre-agreed schedule (e.g., a few days a week or specific weeks per month) to foster team cohesion and collaboration.
*   **Office-Focused, Remote Permitted:** The primary work location for these roles remains the office, but occasional remote work is allowed with prior approval, offering flexibility for personal appointments or focused work periods.

### Eligibility and Implementation

#### Eligibility Criteria

All roles at Acme Corp will be assessed for suitability within the hybrid work model based on the following:

*   The ability to maintain consistent productivity and effective collaboration regardless of location.
*   No inherent requirement for daily physical presence in the office (e.g., roles requiring specialized on-site hardware, direct client interaction at a specific location, or laboratory work).
*   Team members are encouraged to discuss their interest and role suitability for a hybrid model with their direct managers.

#### Leader Approval

All flexible work arrangements under the AcmeFlex model require explicit approval from the employee's direct manager and relevant department head. This ensures alignment with team objectives, project timelines, and overall business needs.

#### Remote Work Environment

Employees participating in remote or hybrid models are responsible for establishing a dedicated workspace that is safe, ergonomic, and conducive to productive work, free from significant distractions. Acme Corp will provide guidelines and resources to support employees in setting up an appropriate home office environment.

### Support and Resources

#### Technology and Infrastructure

Acme Corp will provide the necessary technology and support to facilitate efficient remote and hybrid work. This includes:

*   Company-issued laptops or desktop computers.
*   Access to essential software, secure network connections (VPN), and collaboration tools.
*   Guidelines for requesting additional approved equipment or technical support.

#### Security Measures

Employees are required to strictly adhere to Acme Corp's data protection, information security, and confidentiality policies. This includes the secure use of company networks, devices, and careful handling of all sensitive and proprietary information, regardless of work location.

#### Health and Safety

Acme Corp and its employees share the responsibility for ensuring a safe and healthy work environment. Employees working remotely are expected to follow ergonomic best practices and report any work-related injuries or hazards to their supervisor and HR department promptly.

### Program Participation

#### Enrollment Process

Employees interested in participating in the AcmeFlex hybrid work model should:

*   Discuss their role's eligibility and preferred working category with their direct manager.
*   Complete the official AcmeFlex Application Form, detailing their proposed arrangement and rationale.
*   Obtain final approval from their department head, following review by HR.

#### Allowances and Expenses

Acme Corp provides support for remote and hybrid work setups. Specific details regarding monthly stipends, one-time home office setup allowances, and reimbursement for approved work-related expenses will be communicated separately by the HR and Finance departments, in accordance with company policy and Indian tax regulations.

### Roles and Responsibilities

#### Employees must

*   Maintain consistent communication with their team members and managers, utilizing approved collaboration tools.
*   Adhere to agreed-upon work hours and be readily available for virtual meetings and urgent tasks.

*   Monitor team well-being and productivity, addressing any challenges or concerns promptly and effectively.
*   Facilitate a culture of inclusion where both remote and on-site contributions are valued.

### Expected Hours of Attendance and Availability

*   **Permanent Staff Members:** All full-time employees, whether remote or hybrid, are expected to maintain a standard work week as per their employment contract. Mandatory on-site presence for company-wide events or critical team meetings will be communicated with reasonable advance notice.
*   **Remote-Focused Employees:** While trusted to manage their tasks effectively, remote-focused employees are expected to be available during core business hours (e.g., 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM IST) and utilize communication tools (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack, calendar updates) to indicate their availability and focus times.
*   **Office-Intermittent Employees:** These employees are required to be in the office on their designated days, as agreed with their manager. Department heads may establish preferred in-office days to optimize team collaboration and in-person interaction.
*   **Hourly Workers:** Hourly employees must accurately log their working hours using the designated time-tracking system and submit them for approval. Acme Corp will compensate for all hours worked, including approved overtime, in compliance with Indian labor laws.

### Miscellaneous

All company regulations and policies outlined in our Employee Handbook, including but not limited to anti-harassment, confidentiality, and attendance policies, remain fully applicable to employees working under the AcmeFlex model. This policy is not intended to replace paid sick leave or other forms of approved leave.

### Severance of Agreement

Acme Corp reserves the right to modify or terminate any flexible work arrangement at any time, with appropriate notice, based on business needs, changes in role requirements, or an employee's failure to comply with the terms outlined in this policy. Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action.

### Policy Review and Adaptation

Acme Corp is dedicated to the success and well-being of our 10,000 employees. This policy will be reviewed annually, or as needed, to adapt to evolving business requirements, technological advancements, and feedback from our team.
