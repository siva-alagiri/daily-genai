## Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

The Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp is designed to establish clear guidelines for the appropriate, secure, and professional use of corporate email accounts. As a leading Information Technology firm, email is a critical communication channel for our operations, client interactions, and internal collaboration. This policy aims to ensure that all email communications uphold Acme Corp's professional standards, protect sensitive company and client data, and safeguard our technological infrastructure and reputation from cyber threats and misuse.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email systems and services. This includes individual email accounts, departmental mailboxes, and any other email addresses associated with Acme Corp.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp's email system is a vital tool for business operations. While we provide employees with the flexibility for limited personal use, the primary purpose of corporate email is for work-related activities.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees of Acme Corp are authorized to use their company email for all legitimate business purposes without undue restriction. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and internal teams regarding projects, tasks, and company business.
*   Registering for authorized software, platforms, and services essential for job functions.
*   Professional networking and exchanging contact information at industry events or conferences.
*   Subscribing to industry newsletters, technical forums, or online learning platforms that support professional development and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When utilizing corporate email, employees represent Acme Corp. Therefore, certain activities are strictly prohibited to protect our brand, data, and security:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or defamatory towards any individual or group.
*   Registering for unauthorized competitive services or platforms without explicit management approval.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Accessing, distributing, or linking to illegal, illicit, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Engaging in any activity that misrepresents Acme Corp or its employees.
*   Sharing proprietary code, confidential project details, or sensitive client information without proper authorization.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email communications for compliance with this policy and for security purposes.

**Personal Use**

Employees are permitted reasonable and limited personal use of their corporate email, provided it does not interfere with job duties, violate company policies, or compromise security. Examples include:

*   Registering for professional development courses, webinars, or meetups that may indirectly benefit their career.
*   Sending essential personal communications to friends or family, ensuring no confidential company information is disclosed.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate e-books, guides, or other content for personal learning, provided it does not consume excessive bandwidth or storage.

**Email Security**

Given the nature of our business, email is a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Protecting our email system is paramount to safeguarding Acme Corp's reputation, legal standing, and technological assets.

**Employees must:**

*   Create strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, comprising a minimum of twelve characters, including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords should not contain easily guessable personal information.
*   Avoid writing down passwords or sharing them with anyone.
*   Change their email passwords every 90 days.
*   Ensure their anti-malware and antivirus software on company-issued devices is always updated.

**Employees should also be aware of emails that contain malware or use phishing techniques. Employees are instructed to:**

*   Exercise extreme caution with unexpected attachments or links, especially if the sender or content seems unusual or vague.
*   Be suspicious of emails with sensational or urgent subject lines (clickbait).
*   Always verify the sender's email address and name to confirm legitimacy, especially for requests involving sensitive information or financial transactions.
*   Look for stylistic inconsistencies, grammatical errors, excessive punctuation, or unusual formatting that may indicate a phishing attempt.
*   Report any suspicious emails immediately to the IT Security team for analysis.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to maintain a professional and consistent email signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand identity. This is particularly important for employees who frequently interact with clients and external partners. A standard format should include:

```
[Employee Name]
[Employee Title], [Department]
Acme Corp | [Company Website Link]
[Phone Number] | [Company Address]
```

Employees may include approved company logos or links to official company social media profiles. For assistance in setting up or customizing their signature, employees should contact their direct supervisor or the IT Helpdesk.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Any employee found to be in violation of this Email Usage Policy will face disciplinary action, which may include, but is not limited to, verbal warnings, written reprimands, suspension, or termination of employment. Examples of severe violations that may lead to immediate termination include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company/client information via email.
*   Sending or distributing inappropriate, offensive, or harassing content to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using corporate email for illegal activities or to facilitate fraudulent schemes.

Each incident will be investigated thoroughly, and disciplinary actions will be determined based on the severity and frequency of the violation.
