## Corporate Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This Corporate Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp outlines the expectations for the appropriate and secure use of company-provided email accounts. As a leading Information Technology firm, email is a critical communication tool and a repository of valuable information. This policy aims to ensure professional conduct, safeguard sensitive company data, protect our digital infrastructure from threats, and maintain Acme Corp's reputation.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties granted access to Acme Corp's email systems, whether individually assigned or departmental.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp's email system is provided primarily for business purposes. While reasonable personal use is permitted, all users must adhere to the guidelines below.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Users are authorized to utilize their Acme Corp email for:
*   Official business communications with clients, partners, and internal teams.
*   Accessing approved software, platforms, and online services essential for job functions.
*   Professional networking and information exchange at industry events.
*   Subscribing to professional newsletters or resources that enhance job performance or personal development.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using Acme Corp email, users represent the organization and must refrain from:
*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, offensive, harassing, or sexually explicit.
*   Registering for services or platforms that are competitive with Acme Corp's business without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Accessing or signing up for unreliable, illegal, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Distributing unlawful marketing materials or solicitations.
*   Engaging in any activity that violates company policies, legal regulations, or ethical standards.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all corporate email communications for compliance and security purposes.

**Personal Use**

Limited and reasonable personal use of corporate email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with work duties, compromise company resources, or violate any other company policies. Examples include:
*   Registering for educational courses or professional meetups.
*   Brief, occasional communication with friends and family, ensuring no confidential company information is disclosed.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate guides, e-books, or content for personal learning.

**Email Security**

Email is a common vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches, which can severely impact Acme Corp's operations and reputation. Users must prioritize email security by:
*   Creating strong, unique passwords of at least twelve characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoiding easily guessable personal information.
*   Memorizing passwords rather than writing them down.
*   Changing email passwords every ninety days.
*   Exercising extreme caution with suspicious emails:
    *   Never opening attachments or clicking on links from unknown or unverified senders.
    *   Being wary of urgent or enticing "clickbait" titles.
    *   Verifying the sender's email address and name for legitimacy, looking for subtle misspellings or inconsistencies.
    *   Identifying stylistic red flags such as poor grammar, excessive punctuation, or unusual formatting.
*   Reporting any suspicious emails or potential security incidents immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Ensuring all anti-malware and security software on company-issued devices is regularly updated.

**Email Signature**

All professional emails sent from an Acme Corp account should include a standardized, professional signature. This signature should typically include:
*   Full Name
*   Job Title
*   Acme Corp (with official company link)
*   Official Phone Number (optional, as per departmental guidelines)
*   Company Address (optional, as per departmental guidelines)

Users may include approved company logos or work-related links. For guidance on creating or updating signatures, contact the IT Helpdesk or your direct supervisor.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary company information.
*   Sending or receiving inappropriate, offensive, or harassing content.
*   Using corporate email for illegal activities.

The severity of disciplinary action will be determined based on the nature, frequency, and impact of the violation.
