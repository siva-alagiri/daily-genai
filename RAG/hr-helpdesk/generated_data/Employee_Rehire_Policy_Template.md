## Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp establishes the guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of corporate email accounts by all personnel. As a leading Information Technology firm, email serves as a critical communication channel and a repository of valuable information. This policy aims to ensure professional conduct, safeguard sensitive company data, protect our digital infrastructure from threats, and uphold Acme Corp's reputation.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third-party personnel who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email systems, whether individually or as part of a department. This includes all email accounts ending with `@acmecorp.com` or any other domain officially owned and managed by Acme Corp.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp's email system is provided as an essential tool to facilitate business operations and communication. While we grant employees a degree of flexibility, its primary purpose is professional.

**1. Proper Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email addresses for all work-related activities without undue restriction. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and internal teams.
*   Accessing and registering for business-critical software, platforms, and services.
*   Networking at industry events, conferences, and professional development forums.
*   Subscribing to professional newsletters, research publications, and online resources relevant to their roles and professional growth.

**2. Prohibited Use of Corporate Email**

When utilizing an Acme Corp email address, employees act as representatives of the company. Therefore, certain activities are strictly prohibited to protect our brand, security, and operational integrity:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or defamatory.
*   Registering for or accessing services that are competitive with Acme Corp's business, unless explicitly authorized by senior management.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, or disreputable websites, services, or platforms.
*   Distributing unlawful marketing materials, chain letters, or unauthorized solicitations.
*   Engaging in any activity that violates local laws, company policies, or ethical standards.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all corporate email communications and activity for compliance with this policy and for security purposes.

**3. Limited Personal Use**

Employees are permitted limited personal use of their corporate email, provided it does not interfere with job duties, compromise company resources, or violate any aspect of this policy. Examples of acceptable personal use include:

*   Registering for professional development courses or local community events.
*   Sending brief, non-confidential communications to friends and family.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate educational materials or e-books for personal interest.

**4. Email Security**

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches, which can severely impact Acme Corp's reputation, legal standing, and technological assets. Employees must exercise vigilance and adhere to the following security protocols:

*   **Password Strength:** Set strong, unique passwords of at least twelve characters, incorporating a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names).
*   **Password Management:** Do not write down passwords or share them. Utilize approved password managers if necessary. Passwords must be changed every 90 days.
*   **Phishing Awareness:** Be highly suspicious of emails that:
    *   Contain unexpected attachments or links with vague descriptions.
    *   Use urgent or threatening language to demand immediate action.
    *   Exhibit poor grammar, spelling, or inconsistent formatting.
    *   Request personal or login credentials.
    *   Appear to be from known contacts but have unusual sender addresses.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Emails:** If an email appears suspicious or its legitimacy is uncertain, employees must immediately report it to the IT Security team and refrain from clicking links or opening attachments.
*   **Anti-Malware:** Ensure that all company-issued devices used for email access have up-to-date anti-malware and antivirus software installed and running.

**5. Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to maintain a professional and consistent email signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand identity. For client-facing roles, a standardized signature is mandatory. A recommended format is:

```
[Your Full Name]
[Your Job Title]
Acme Corp | [Your Department]
[Your Phone Number (optional)] | [Your Email Address]
[Company Website Link] | [Company Address]
```

Images, company logos, and links to professional social media profiles (e.g., LinkedIn) may be included if they align with company branding guidelines. Assistance with signature setup is available from the IT Helpdesk or your direct supervisor.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Any employee found to be in violation of this Email Usage Policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include, but is not limited to, verbal warnings, written reprimands, suspension, or immediate termination of employment. Examples of severe violations include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary company information via email.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using corporate email for illegal activities or to facilitate fraud.
*   Repeated failure to adhere to email security protocols, leading to a security incident.

Each incident will be investigated thoroughly, and disciplinary measures will be applied based on the severity and frequency of the violation, as well as its impact on Acme Corp. This policy remains in effect even after an employee's separation from the company regarding the handling of past communications and data.
