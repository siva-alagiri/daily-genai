**Company Email Usage Policy**

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

The Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp is designed to establish clear guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of corporate email accounts by all employees. As a leading Information Technology company, email is a critical communication channel and a repository of sensitive data. This policy aims to safeguard Acme Corp's intellectual property, maintain professional standards, protect against cyber threats, and ensure compliance with data protection regulations in India.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all permanent, temporary, and contract employees, as well as consultants and any third parties granted access to Acme Corp's email systems, whether individually assigned or departmentally managed. This includes email accessed from company-issued devices or personal devices used for work purposes.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp's email system is a vital business tool, provided to facilitate official communications and support professional responsibilities. While employees are afforded reasonable flexibility, all usage must align with company values and security protocols.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email accounts for all work-related activities, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and colleagues on official business.
*   Accessing and registering for professional software, platforms, and services necessary for job functions.
*   Networking at industry events, conferences, and professional development forums.
*   Subscribing to industry newsletters, technical journals, and educational resources relevant to their role and professional growth.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When utilizing an Acme Corp email address, employees represent the company. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or defamatory.
*   Registering for or accessing websites, services, or applications that are unreliable, illegal, or pose a security risk.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information without explicit authorization.
*   Engaging in political lobbying, personal commercial activities, or any other non-business-related activities that could compromise company resources or reputation.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of corporate email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job duties, violate company policies, or compromise security. Examples of acceptable personal use include:

*   Registering for personal development courses or professional networking events.
*   Brief communications with family and friends, ensuring no confidential information is shared.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate educational materials or e-books for personal learning.

**Email Security**

Email is a primary vector for cyberattacks, including phishing, malware, and data breaches. Protecting our email system is paramount to maintaining Acme Corp's operational integrity and reputation.

Employees must:

*   Establish strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoiding easily guessable personal information.
*   Change email passwords every 90 days.
*   Never write down or share passwords.
*   Ensure anti-malware and antivirus software on company devices is up-to-date.

Employees should exercise extreme caution regarding suspicious emails and are instructed to:

*   Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links from unknown senders or when the content is vaguely described.
*   Be wary of emails with urgent or sensational subject lines (clickbait).
*   Verify the sender's email address and name for legitimacy, looking for subtle inconsistencies.
*   Identify stylistic red flags such as grammatical errors, excessive punctuation, or unusual formatting.

Any employee uncertain about the safety of an email should immediately contact the IT Security team for verification.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to maintain a professional email signature that accurately reflects their role and represents Acme Corp. The standard format should include:

`[Employee Name]`
`[Employee Title], Acme Corp`
`[Company Website Link]`
`[Phone Number (optional)] | [Company Address (optional)]`

Company logos or work-related links may be included if approved by the Marketing department. Guidance on signature setup is available from the IT Helpdesk or direct supervisor.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Failure to adhere to this Email Usage Policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Examples of severe violations include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential company, client, or partner information.
*   Sending or receiving inappropriate, offensive, or harassing content.
*   Using corporate email for illegal activities or to facilitate fraud.
*   Repeated disregard for email security protocols after warnings.

The severity of disciplinary action will be determined based on the nature, frequency, and impact of the violation.
