**Work-From-Home Policy**

**Effective Date:** October 26, 2023

**1. Purpose:**
This Work-From-Home (WFH) Policy at Acme Corp establishes a framework for remote work arrangements, promoting flexibility, enhancing employee well-being, and ensuring business continuity. It outlines the expectations and guidelines for employees whose roles can be effectively performed outside the traditional office environment, leveraging technology to maintain productivity and collaboration within our Information Technology operations.

**2. Eligibility:**
This policy applies to all permanent employees of Acme Corp whose job responsibilities are deemed suitable for remote execution by their department head and Human Resources. Eligibility is contingent upon consistent strong performance, adherence to company policies, and the nature of the role not requiring a constant physical presence in the office. New hires may be eligible after successfully completing their probationary period.

**3. Approval Process:**
Employees interested in a work-from-home arrangement must submit a formal request to their immediate supervisor, detailing the proposed schedule and rationale. All requests require approval from the department head and Human Resources, considering business operational needs, team dynamics, and the employee's performance record. Approved arrangements will be documented and reviewed periodically.

**4. Equipment and Security:**
Acme Corp will provide essential equipment, such as laptops and necessary software licenses, for approved remote work. Employees are responsible for maintaining a secure and functional home workspace, including a reliable internet connection. Strict adherence to Acme Corp's cybersecurity protocols, data protection policies, and secure network access procedures is mandatory to safeguard company information and intellectual property.

**5. Work Hours:**
Remote employees are expected to maintain their standard working hours as agreed with their supervisor, ensuring availability for meetings and collaboration during core business hours. Any deviations from the standard schedule, including overtime or time-off requests, must be pre-approved in accordance with existing company policies and Indian labor laws.

**6. Communication:**
Effective and timely communication is paramount for remote work success. Employees are required to utilize company-approved communication platforms (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack, email) to stay connected with their teams, supervisors, and clients. Prompt responses to messages and active participation in virtual meetings are expected.

**7. Productivity and Performance:**
Performance expectations for remote employees are consistent with those for in-office personnel. Supervisors will regularly monitor output, project milestones, and overall contribution. Acme Corp is committed to providing support and resources to help remote employees maintain high levels of productivity and achieve their objectives.

**8. Health and Safety:**
Employees working from home are responsible for establishing and maintaining a safe, ergonomic, and distraction-free workspace. Acme Corp will provide guidance on ergonomic best practices. Employees must report any work-related injuries or incidents occurring in their remote workspace to their supervisor and HR immediately.

**9. Expenses:**
Acme Corp will reimburse reasonable and pre-approved business expenses directly related to remote work, such as specific software subscriptions or essential office supplies not provided by the company. Employees must submit expense reports with valid receipts in accordance with the company's expense policy. Personal utility costs (e.g., electricity, internet) are generally the employee's responsibility unless explicitly agreed otherwise for specific roles or circumstances.

**10. Termination of Remote Work Agreement:**
Acme Corp reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate any work-from-home arrangement at its sole discretion, with appropriate notice, based on business needs, changes in job responsibilities, performance concerns, or policy non-compliance.

**11. Confidentiality:**
All remote employees must strictly adhere to Acme Corp's confidentiality and data protection policies. Unauthorized disclosure, access, or misuse of sensitive company, client, or employee information, regardless of location, will result in severe disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and legal proceedings.

**12. Compliance:**
All employees working remotely must comply with all applicable Indian labor laws, company policies, and regulations. This includes policies related to conduct, data security, and intellectual property.

**13. Acknowledgment:**
By participating in the Work-From-Home program, employees acknowledge their understanding and agreement to comply with all terms and conditions outlined in this policy.

**14. Review and Updates:**
