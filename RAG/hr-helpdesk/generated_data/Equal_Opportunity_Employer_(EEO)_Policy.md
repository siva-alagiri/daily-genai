### Corporate Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This Corporate Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp outlines the expectations and guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of company-provided email accounts. As a leading Information Technology firm with a global presence, email is a critical communication tool. This policy is designed to safeguard Acme Corp's intellectual property, protect sensitive client and company data, uphold our professional reputation, and ensure compliance with relevant data protection laws in India and internationally. It promotes efficient and ethical communication practices among all personnel.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties who are granted access to or use Acme Corp's email systems, whether for individual or departmental purposes, across all our offices and operational locations in India and worldwide.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp's email system is a valuable asset provided to facilitate business operations. While we offer a degree of flexibility, all usage must align with our company values and legal obligations.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email accounts for all legitimate business-related activities without undue restriction. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Networking and exchanging information at industry events, conferences, and professional development forums.
*   Subscribing to professional newsletters, industry updates, and educational platforms that support professional growth and job performance.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using an Acme Corp email address, employees represent the company. Therefore, certain activities are strictly prohibited to protect our integrity and security:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, defamatory, or sexually explicit.
*   Unauthorized sharing or transmission of confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company, client, or employee information.

*   Impersonating another individual or misrepresenting one's authority.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor email communications for compliance with this policy and for security purposes.

**Personal Use**

Acme Corp acknowledges that employees may occasionally need to use their corporate email for limited personal matters. Acceptable personal use includes:

*   Registering for personal development courses, workshops, or professional networking events.
*   Brief communications with family and friends, provided it does not disclose confidential information or interfere with work duties.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate guides, e-books, or other content for personal interest, ensuring no company resources are misused.

**Email Security**

Email remains a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches, which can severely impact Acme Corp's operations and reputation. Employees must adhere to the following security protocols:

*   **Password Strength:** Create and maintain strong, unique passwords of at least twelve characters, incorporating a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names).
*   **Password Rotation:** Change email passwords every 90 days. New passwords must not be identical to any of the previous five passwords.
*   **Phishing Awareness:** Exercise extreme caution with emails from unknown senders, suspicious subject lines, or unexpected attachments/links. Always verify the sender's legitimacy before clicking or downloading.
*   **Reporting Threats:** Immediately report any suspicious emails, perceived security threats, or unusual account activity to the IT Security team.
*   **Anti-Malware:** Ensure that company-issued devices have up-to-date anti-malware and antivirus software.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to use a professional email signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand identity. This typically includes:

*   Employee's Full Name
*   Job Title
*   Department
*   Acme Corp (with official company website link)
*   Official Company Phone Number
*   Company Address

Images, company logos, and links to work-related content are permitted. Employees unsure about creating or updating their signature should consult their manager or the Marketing department for guidance.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Any violation of this Corporate Email Usage Policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may range from a verbal warning to immediate termination of employment, depending on the severity and frequency of the offense. Examples of violations that may lead to disciplinary action include:
