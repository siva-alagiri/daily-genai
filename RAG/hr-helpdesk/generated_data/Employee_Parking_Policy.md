## Work-From-Home Policy

**Effective Date:** [Current Date]

**1. Purpose:**
The purpose of this Work-From-Home (WFH) Policy is to establish clear guidelines and expectations for employees of Acme Corp who are approved to work remotely. This policy aims to foster a flexible work environment that supports employee well-being and productivity while ensuring business continuity and data security for our Information Technology operations.

**2. Eligibility:**
Employees eligible for remote work under this policy will be determined by Acme Corp based on the nature of their role, job responsibilities, and consistent performance. Roles requiring constant physical presence, specialized equipment, or direct client interaction on-site may not be eligible. Eligibility is also contingent on the employee having a suitable home workspace and a proven track record of self-management.

**3. Approval Process:**
Employees interested in a WFH arrangement must submit a formal request to their immediate supervisor, outlining the proposed schedule and justification. Requests will be reviewed based on business needs, team dynamics, job responsibilities, and the employee's performance history. Final approval rests with the department head and HR.

**4. Equipment and Security:**
4.1. Employees working remotely are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of Acme Corp's information and intellectual property.
4.2. Acme Corp will provide necessary company-issued equipment (e.g., laptop, monitor) and resources for remote work. Employees must ensure a secure and stable internet connection at their remote location.
4.3. All remote work must adhere strictly to Acme Corp's Cybersecurity and Data Protection policies. This includes using VPNs, strong passwords, and avoiding public Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks.

**5. Work Hours:**
5.1. Remote employees are expected to adhere to their regular work hours and be available during core business hours as agreed with their supervisor, unless alternative arrangements are formally approved.
5.2. Overtime and time-off policies, in compliance with Indian labor laws, remain applicable to remote employees. Any overtime must be pre-approved by the supervisor.

**6. Communication:**
6.1. Remote employees must maintain regular and proactive communication with their supervisors and team members using company-approved collaboration tools (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack, email).
6.2. Responsiveness to messages, emails, and meeting invitations is crucial to ensure seamless team collaboration and project progress.

**7. Productivity and Performance:**
7.1. Performance expectations for remote employees are consistent with those for in-office employees. Remote work is a work arrangement, not a reduction in responsibilities or output.
7.2. Regular performance reviews and check-ins will be conducted to ensure accountability and productivity, focusing on deliverables and outcomes.

**8. Health and Safety:**
8.1. Employees are responsible for maintaining a safe and ergonomically sound work environment at their remote location.

**9. Expenses:**
Employees will be reimbursed for approved business expenses directly related to remote work (e.g., specific software licenses, approved office supplies) as per Acme Corp's Employee Business Expense Policy. Personal utility costs (internet, electricity) are generally not reimbursed unless explicitly agreed upon for specific roles or circumstances.

**10. Termination of Remote Work Agreement:**
Acme Corp reserves the right to terminate or modify any remote work arrangement at any time based on business needs, changes in job responsibilities, performance concerns, or policy violations, with appropriate notice.
