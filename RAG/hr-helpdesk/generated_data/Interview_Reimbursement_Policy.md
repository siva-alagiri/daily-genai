## Remote and Flexible Work Policy

### Policy Brief & Purpose

Acme Corp is committed to fostering a dynamic and inclusive work environment that supports employee well-being, enhances productivity, and ensures business continuity. This Remote and Flexible Work Policy outlines the framework for employees to perform their duties from approved non-office locations, either fully or on a hybrid basis. Our aim is to leverage modern work models to attract and retain top talent, promote work-life integration, and maintain operational excellence while adhering to our core values and security standards.

### Scope

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees, contractors, and consultants of Acme Corp in India, whose roles are deemed suitable for remote or hybrid work arrangements. It covers all aspects of working from a non-office location, including expectations, responsibilities, and resource provisions.

### Policy Elements

#### Remote Work Categories

Acme Corp recognizes various flexible work arrangements to accommodate diverse roles and team needs:

1.  **Fully Remote**: Employees whose roles do not require a regular physical presence in an Acme Corp office and who perform all duties from an approved remote location.
2.  **Structured Hybrid**: Employees who work from an Acme Corp office on specific, pre-determined days each week or month, and remotely for the remainder of their work schedule.
3.  **Flexible Hybrid**: Employees who primarily work from an Acme Corp office but have the flexibility to work remotely as needed, based on project requirements, team collaboration, and manager approval.

#### Eligibility

Eligibility for remote or flexible work arrangements will be determined based on the following criteria:

*   **Role Suitability**: The nature of the job responsibilities must be conducive to remote execution without significant impact on productivity or team collaboration.
*   **Performance Record**: Employees must have a consistent record of strong performance, reliability, and adherence to company policies.
*   **Team & Business Needs**: The arrangement must align with the operational requirements of the team and the broader business objectives, ensuring no disruption to client service or internal workflows.
*   **Manager Approval**: All remote and flexible work arrangements require explicit approval from the employee's direct manager and relevant department head.

#### Work Environment Expectations

Employees working remotely are responsible for establishing a dedicated workspace that is:

*   **Safe & Ergonomic**: Conducive to health and safety, minimizing physical strain and distractions.
*   **Productive**: Equipped with reliable internet connectivity and a suitable environment for focused work.
*   **Professional**: Maintained in a manner that allows for professional conduct during virtual meetings and interactions.

*   **Transparency**: Clearly communicate their work schedule, availability, and any potential changes to their team and manager.

#### Performance & Accountability

Performance expectations for remote and hybrid employees are consistent with those for in-office employees. Evaluation will be outcome-based, focusing on deliverables, quality of work, and contribution to team and company goals, rather than physical presence. Managers will set clear objectives and provide regular feedback.
