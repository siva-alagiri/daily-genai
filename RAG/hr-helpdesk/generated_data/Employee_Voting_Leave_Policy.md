## Company Email Usage Policy

**Purpose**

This policy at Acme Corp establishes the guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of company-provided email accounts. Its aim is to ensure that electronic communications uphold our professional standards, protect sensitive information, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements, thereby safeguarding our reputation and digital assets.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all individuals who are granted access to or use Acme Corp's email systems, including permanent employees, temporary staff, contractors, consultants, and any third parties communicating on behalf of the company.

**Components of the Policy**

**1. Acceptable Use of Company Email**
Company email is a primary communication channel for business operations. Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email for:
*   Official business communications with clients, partners, and internal teams.
*   Accessing company-approved software, platforms, and online services essential for job functions.
*   Professional networking and engagement at industry events or conferences.
*   Limited and reasonable personal communications that do not interfere with work duties or violate other company policies.

**2. Prohibited Use of Company Email**
Employees must refrain from using company email for activities that could compromise Acme Corp's integrity, security, or professional standing. Prohibited uses include, but are not limited to:
*   Sending or transmitting any content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or illegal.
*   Registering for or accessing websites, services, or subscriptions that are unauthorized, illegal, or pose a security risk.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information to unauthorized individuals or entities.
*   Engaging in unsolicited commercial emails (spamming) or chain letters.
*   Participating in political lobbying, personal financial gain activities, or outside business ventures without explicit company approval.

**3. Email Security**
Email systems are vulnerable to cyber threats. Employees are crucial in maintaining email security:
*   **Password Management:** Create strong, unique passwords (minimum 12 characters, mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) and change them every 90 days. Never share passwords.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Exercise extreme caution with suspicious emails. Do not click on unfamiliar links, open unexpected attachments, or respond to requests for personal or company data.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Activity:** Immediately report any suspected phishing attempts, malware, or unauthorized access to the IT Security team.
*   **Data Handling:** Avoid sending highly sensitive or confidential data via unencrypted email. Use approved secure file transfer methods when necessary.

**4. Email Signature**
To maintain a consistent and professional brand image, employees are required to use a standardized email signature for all external communications. The signature should include:
*   Employee's Full Name
*   Job Title

*   Company Phone Number (optional)
*   Company Address (optional)
Images, logos, or additional links must be approved by the Marketing department.
