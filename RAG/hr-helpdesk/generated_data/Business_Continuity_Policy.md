## Company Cyber Security Policy

**Policy brief & purpose**

At Acme Corp, our commitment to innovation and client trust is paramount. This Cyber Security Policy outlines our comprehensive framework for safeguarding our digital assets, intellectual property, and sensitive client information. As a leading Information Technology firm with a global footprint and 10,000 employees, we recognize that robust cybersecurity is fundamental to our operational integrity, reputation, and continued success. This policy is designed to mitigate risks from cyber threats, ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and foster a culture of security awareness across the organization.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, and any third-party vendors or individuals who have access to Acme Corp's information systems, networks, data, or physical premises, regardless of their location or the device used to access company resources.

**Policy elements**

**Confidential Data**

Confidential data at Acme Corp is defined as any information that is not publicly available and whose unauthorized disclosure could cause harm to the company, its clients, or its employees. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Proprietary software, algorithms, and source code.
*   Client data, project specifications, and contractual agreements.
*   Financial records, business strategies, and market research.
*   Employee personal information and HR records.
*   Unpublished research and development findings.

All personnel are obligated to protect this data with the highest level of diligence.

**Protect Personal and Company Devices**

All devices used to access Acme Corp resources, whether company-issued or personal (under BYOD policy), must adhere to strict security standards. Personnel must:

*   Ensure all devices are password-protected with strong, unique credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) where available.
*   Install and maintain up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware software provided or approved by Acme Corp IT.
*   Apply security patches and operating system updates promptly.
*   Never leave devices unattended or unsecured in public or shared spaces.
*   Utilize approved Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections for all remote access to company networks.
*   Report lost or stolen devices immediately to the IT Security team.

**Keep Emails Safe**

Email remains a primary vector for cyber threats. To prevent phishing, malware, and business email compromise (BEC), all personnel must:

*   Exercise extreme caution with unsolicited emails, especially those containing links or attachments.
*   Verify the sender's identity and legitimacy before clicking on links, downloading attachments, or responding to requests for sensitive information.
*   Be suspicious of urgent or unusual requests, even if they appear to come from internal colleagues or senior management.
*   Report any suspicious emails to the IT Security team using designated reporting tools.
*   Avoid using personal email accounts for company business or sharing company information via personal email.

**Manage Passwords Properly**

Strong password hygiene is critical for protecting access to Acme Corp systems. Personnel must:

*   Create complex passwords of at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
*   Avoid using easily guessable information (e.g., birthdays, common words).
*   Never share passwords with anyone, including colleagues or IT support.
*   Utilize Acme Corp's approved password manager for storing and generating secure passwords.
*   Change passwords immediately if there is any suspicion of compromise.
*   Enable and use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all accounts where it is supported.

**Transfer Data Securely**

The secure transfer of data is essential to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Personnel must:

*   Use only approved, encrypted channels and platforms for sharing confidential or sensitive company data (e.g., secure file transfer services, encrypted cloud storage).
*   Avoid transferring sensitive data to unencrypted personal devices or public cloud services.
*   Verify the recipient's identity and authorization before transmitting any confidential information.
*   Adhere to Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies and tools implemented by Acme Corp.
*   Consult with the IT Security team for guidance on secure data transfer methods for large or highly sensitive datasets.

**Report Scams, Privacy Breaches, and Hacking Attempts**

Vigilance from every employee is a key defense against cyber threats. Personnel must:

*   Report any suspected security incidents, privacy breaches, or hacking attempts immediately to the IT Security team, regardless of perceived severity.
*   This includes unusual system behavior, unauthorized access attempts, or accidental disclosure of sensitive information.
*   Provide all available details to assist in prompt investigation and resolution.

**Additional Measures**

Acme Corp implements and expects adherence to the following:

*   **Regular Security Training:** Mandatory annual cybersecurity awareness training for all personnel, with specialized training for roles handling sensitive data or critical systems.
*   **Secure Development Practices:** Integration of security best practices into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for all internal and client-facing applications.
*   **Physical Security:** Adherence to physical access controls for data centers, server rooms, and offices.
*   **Third-Party Risk Management:** Due diligence and contractual agreements with vendors to ensure their security practices align with Acme Corp's standards.
*   **Incident Response Plan:** Familiarity with and adherence to established procedures for responding to and recovering from cyber incidents.

**Remote Employees**

Personnel working remotely must ensure their home network is secure and their workspace protects company data. This includes:

*   Using strong, unique passwords for home Wi-Fi networks.
*   Ensuring physical security of company devices and documents in their remote workspace to prevent unauthorized access by household members or visitors.
*   Avoiding public Wi-Fi for accessing company resources unless a secure VPN is actively used.
*   Maintaining a clear desk policy for sensitive documents.

**Disciplinary Action**

Acme Corp takes cybersecurity seriously. Any violation of this policy, whether intentional or unintentional, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or contract. Severe breaches, particularly those involving unauthorized access, disclosure of confidential information, or actions that compromise client data or intellectual property, may also lead to legal action and reporting to relevant authorities in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Each incident will be investigated thoroughly and handled on a case-by-case basis, with consideration for intent, impact, and prior compliance history.
