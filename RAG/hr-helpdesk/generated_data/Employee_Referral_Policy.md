## Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp outlines the expected standards for the appropriate and secure use of corporate email accounts by all personnel. As a leading Information Technology firm, email is a critical communication and collaboration tool. This policy aims to safeguard Acme Corp's proprietary information, maintain our professional reputation, and protect our technological infrastructure from potential threats, ensuring compliance with data protection standards prevalent in India.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties granted access to or assigned an Acme Corp email address, whether individually or as part of a department. This includes all forms of email communication and data stored within the Acme Corp email system.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp's email system is provided to facilitate business operations and professional communication. While primarily for work-related purposes, we acknowledge that limited, reasonable personal use is permissible, provided it adheres to the guidelines outlined herein.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email accounts for all legitimate business activities, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, and internal teams regarding project updates, technical discussions, and operational matters.
*   Accessing and utilizing company-approved software, platforms, and services essential for job functions.
*   Exchanging professional information at industry conferences, networking events, or with educational institutions for career development.
*   Subscribing to industry newsletters, technical forums, or professional development resources that enhance job performance or knowledge.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using an Acme Corp email account, employees represent the company. Therefore, certain activities are strictly prohibited to protect our integrity and security:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or derogatory based on protected characteristics (e.g., caste, religion, gender, disability).
*   Registering for or accessing services, websites, or platforms that are unrelated to business, unauthorized, or could pose a security risk.
*   Engaging in unsolicited mass emailing (spamming) or sending chain letters, especially to colleagues or external contacts.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company, client, or partner information without explicit authorization.
*   Participating in any illegal activities, including but not limited to intellectual property infringement, fraud, or distribution of malicious content.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor email communications and usage to ensure compliance with this policy and to protect company assets.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of corporate email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with work duties, violate company policies, or compromise security. Examples include:

*   Registering for professional development courses, webinars, or local community events.
*   Sending brief, occasional emails to family or friends, ensuring no confidential information is shared and it does not constitute spam.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate non-work-related content (e.g., e-books, articles) that does not consume excessive bandwidth or storage.

**Email Security**

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Employees must exercise vigilance to protect company and personal data.

*   **Password Management:**
    *   Set strong, unique passwords of at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information easily guessed.
    *   Never write down or share passwords. Utilize secure password managers if necessary.
    *   Change email passwords every 90 days.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:**
    *   Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or suspicious senders, or when the content is inadequately explained or unexpected.
    *   Be wary of emails with urgent or alarming language, unexpected requests for personal information, or offers that seem too good to be true.
    *   Always verify the sender's email address and look for inconsistencies (e.g., grammatical errors, unusual formatting, excessive punctuation).
    *   If unsure about an email's legitimacy, contact the sender through an alternative, verified communication channel or forward the email to the IT Security team for review.
*   **Software Updates:**
    *   Ensure that all anti-malware and security software on company-issued devices is regularly updated.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to maintain a professional and consistent email signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand identity. This is particularly important for individuals interacting with clients and external partners. A standard format should include:

```
[Your Full Name]
[Your Job Title]
[Your Department]
Acme Corp
[Company Website Link]
[Company Phone Number (Optional)]
[Company Address (Optional)]
```

Images, company logos, and links to professional social media profiles (e.g., LinkedIn) are permitted if they align with company branding guidelines. For assistance with signature setup, employees should contact their direct supervisor or the IT department.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Any violation of this Email Usage Policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, in accordance with Acme Corp's Disciplinary Policy. Examples of severe violations include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential company, client, or partner information via email.
*   Sending or receiving emails containing illegal, discriminatory, or highly offensive content.
*   Using corporate email for activities that directly harm Acme Corp's reputation or business interests.
*   Repeated failure to adhere to email security protocols, leading to significant risk or actual security incidents.

The severity of the disciplinary action will depend on the nature, frequency, and impact of the violation.
