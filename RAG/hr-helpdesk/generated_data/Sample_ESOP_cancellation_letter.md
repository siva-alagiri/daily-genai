# Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This policy outlines the guidelines and expectations for the appropriate, secure, and professional use of official Acme Corp email accounts. Its primary purpose is to ensure effective communication, safeguard sensitive company information, maintain our corporate reputation, and ensure compliance with data protection laws and internal security protocols. By establishing clear standards, we aim to foster a productive and secure digital environment for all employees.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all permanent, contractual, and temporary employees, as well as consultants and third-party personnel who are provided with or use an official Acme Corp email address for business communication. This includes individual and departmental email accounts, irrespective of the device (company-issued or personal) or location from which the email is accessed.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Acme Corp email is a vital communication channel provided to facilitate business operations and professional interactions. Employees are authorized to use their company email for:

*   **Official Business Communication:** Engaging in correspondence with clients, partners, vendors, and internal colleagues for work-related matters.
*   **Collaboration and Project Management:** Sharing documents, updates, and information pertinent to ongoing projects and team collaboration.
*   **Accessing Business Applications:** Logging into company-approved software, platforms, and services necessary for job functions.
*   **Professional Networking:** Representing Acme Corp at industry events, conferences, or professional forums where business contact information is exchanged.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using an Acme Corp email address, employees are representing the company. Therefore, certain uses are strictly prohibited to protect our integrity, security, and legal standing:

*   **Transmission of Illegal or Offensive Content:** Sending, receiving, or storing emails containing discriminatory, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or illegal material.
*   **Unauthorized Disclosure of Confidential Information:** Sharing proprietary data, trade secrets, client lists, financial records, or any other sensitive company or client information without explicit authorization.
*   **Spamming or Unsolicited Mass Mailings:** Sending unsolicited commercial emails or large volumes of non-work-related messages.
*   **Engaging in Fraudulent or Deceptive Activities:** Using email for phishing, impersonation, or any other fraudulent schemes.
*   **Misrepresenting Acme Corp:** Sending communications that falsely claim to represent the company's official stance or policies.
*   **Registration for Unauthorized Services:** Signing up for unreliable, illegal, or suspicious websites/services that could compromise company security.
*   **Political or Religious Advocacy:** Using company email for personal political campaigning, religious proselytization, or other non-work-related advocacy.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate emails for compliance with this policy and for security purposes.

**Personal Use**

Limited and reasonable personal use of company email is permitted, provided it does not:

*   Interfere with job performance or productivity.
*   Consume excessive network resources or storage.
*   Compromise the security or integrity of company systems.
*   Violate any other company policies, including those on confidentiality, anti-harassment, or code of conduct.
*   Examples of acceptable personal use include essential personal communications or accessing non-work-related educational content that does not pose a security risk.

**Email Security**

Email remains a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. All employees must adhere to the following security protocols:

*   **Strong Passwords:** Set and regularly update complex passwords (minimum eight characters, combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) that are not easily guessable and do not contain personal information.
*   **Password Management:** Never share email passwords. If passwords must be recorded, they should be stored securely and destroyed when no longer needed.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:**
    *   Exercise extreme caution with unsolicited emails, especially those with attachments or links.
    *   Verify the sender's identity and legitimacy before opening attachments or clicking links.
    *   Be wary of urgent requests for personal or company information.
    *   Report any suspicious emails immediately to the IT Security team.
*   **Device Security:** Ensure that any device used to access company email (company-issued or personal) is protected with up-to-date antivirus software, firewalls, and operating system security patches.
*   **Confidentiality:** Avoid discussing sensitive company or client information via unsecured personal email accounts.

**Email Signature**

To maintain a consistent and professional corporate image, all outgoing emails should include a standardized signature. Employees are encouraged to create a signature that includes:

*   Employee's Full Name
*   Job Title
*   Department
*   Acme Corp Name and Official Website Link
*   Official Company Phone Number
*   Company Address
*   A standard legal disclaimer (if required by the company or local regulations).

Employees can consult with their manager or the Marketing/IT department for guidance on setting up their official email signature, including approved company logos or branding elements.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Any violation of this Email Usage Policy will be taken seriously and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. The severity of the disciplinary action will depend on the nature and impact of the violation, including whether it was intentional, repeated, or resulted in significant harm to Acme Corp, its employees, clients, or reputation. Severe breaches, such as unauthorized disclosure of confidential data or engagement in illegal activities, may also lead to legal action.
