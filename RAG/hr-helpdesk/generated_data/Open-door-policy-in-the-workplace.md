*   Networking and professional development at industry events.
*   Receiving work-relevant updates, newsletters, and subscriptions that support professional growth.

*   Verify sender authenticity and look for common phishing indicators (e.g., grammatical errors, unusual requests, mismatched domains).
*   Report any suspected phishing attempts, malware, or security incidents immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Ensure all company-issued devices used for email access have up-to-date security software and operating system patches.
*   Never share email credentials with anyone, including IT personnel.

To ensure consistent professional representation, all outgoing emails should include a standardized signature. This typically includes:

*   Employee's Full Name
*   Job Title
*   Acme Corp (with official website link)
