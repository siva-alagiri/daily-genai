*   Change email passwords every 90 days or as prompted by IT security protocols.
*   Be cautious of suspicious emails and attachments. Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown senders or if the content seems unusual or inadequately explained.
*   Verify the sender's email address and name for legitimacy, especially for requests involving sensitive information or financial transactions.
*   Report any suspected phishing attempts, malware, or security vulnerabilities immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Ensure that anti-malware and security software on company-issued devices are always updated.
