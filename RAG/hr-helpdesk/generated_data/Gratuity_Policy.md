## Company Email Usage Policy

### POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE

This policy establishes the guidelines for the appropriate, secure, and professional use of email services provided by Acme Corp. Our email system is a vital communication and collaboration tool, and its responsible use is paramount to maintaining data integrity, protecting proprietary information, and upholding the company's reputation. This policy aims to ensure that all email communications align with our corporate values, legal obligations, and security standards.

### SCOPE

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any other individuals granted access to Acme Corp's email systems and associated services, regardless of their employment status, location, or device used for access. This includes individual and departmental email accounts.

### COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY

#### Correct Use of Corporate Email

Acme Corp's email system is provided primarily for business-related communications and activities. Employees are authorized to use their corporate email for:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and colleagues for official business.
*   Collaborating on projects, sharing work-related documents, and exchanging necessary information.
*   Accessing and utilizing company-approved software, platforms, and cloud services that require email authentication.
*   Receiving official company announcements, updates, and internal communications.
*   Professional networking and engagement at industry events, conferences, or webinars relevant to their role and the company's interests.

#### Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email

When using corporate email, employees represent Acme Corp. Therefore, the following activities are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, defamatory, or sexually explicit.
*   Engaging in unauthorized political lobbying, religious proselytizing, or commercial solicitations.
*   Registering for or accessing unreliable, illegal, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Sharing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information with unauthorized individuals or entities.
*   Attempting to bypass email security measures or access accounts without proper authorization.
*   Using email for personal financial gain unrelated to Acme Corp's business.

#### Personal Use

Acme Corp acknowledges that employees may occasionally need to use their corporate email for limited personal communications. Such use is permitted under the following conditions:

*   It does not interfere with job duties, productivity, or the performance of others.
*   It does not involve the disclosure of confidential company information or intellectual property.
*   It adheres to all other aspects of this policy, particularly regarding inappropriate content and security.
*   It is not used for illegal activities or activities that could bring disrepute to Acme Corp.

Employees should be aware that all communications sent or received via company email are considered company property and may be monitored in accordance with legal and company guidelines.

#### Email Security

Email is a common vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Employees must exercise extreme caution and adhere to the following security protocols:

*   **Strong Passwords:** Set and maintain complex passwords for email accounts, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable information (e.g., birthdays, common words).
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable and utilize MFA wherever available for enhanced account security.
*   **Phishing Awareness:** Be vigilant for suspicious emails. Do not click on unfamiliar links, open unexpected attachments, or provide login credentials in response to unverified requests. Always verify the sender's legitimacy.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Activity:** Immediately report any suspicious emails, unauthorized access attempts, or security concerns to the IT Security team.
*   **Data Handling:** Avoid sending sensitive company data via unencrypted email. Utilize approved secure file-sharing methods for such information.
*   **Regular Changes:** Change email passwords periodically as mandated by IT Security policies.

#### Email Signature

Employees are encouraged to use a standardized, professional email signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand identity. The signature should include:

*   Employee's Full Name
*   Job Title
*   Acme Corp (with official company website link)
*   Official Phone Number (if applicable)
*   Company Address

Images, company logos, and links to official company social media profiles may be included if they adhere to brand guidelines. Employees unsure about signature creation should consult their manager or the Marketing department for guidance.

### DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES

*   Engaging in illegal activities or harassment via corporate email.
