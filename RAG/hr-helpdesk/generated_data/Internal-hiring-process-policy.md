## Acme Corp Corporate Email Usage Policy

### POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE

This Corporate Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp establishes the guidelines for the appropriate, secure, and professional use of company-provided email accounts and systems. Our objective is to facilitate efficient business communication, safeguard sensitive information, maintain our corporate reputation, and ensure compliance with internal policies and relevant Indian legal frameworks. This policy underscores the importance of email as a critical business tool and outlines expectations for its responsible utilization by all personnel.

### SCOPE

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties granted access to or utilizing Acme Corp's email systems, services, and infrastructure, regardless of their employment status, location, or the device used to access these resources. This includes individual and departmental email accounts.

### COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY

#### Correct Use of Corporate Email

Acme Corp email accounts are provided for official business communications and activities that support the company's objectives. Employees are authorized to use their corporate email for:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and colleagues on work-related matters.
*   Accessing and utilizing company-approved software, platforms, and services necessary for job functions.
*   Participating in professional development activities, webinars, or industry forums relevant to their role.
*   Official correspondence and documentation as required by their job responsibilities.

#### Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email

When using corporate email, employees represent Acme Corp. Therefore, the following activities are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending, forwarding, or storing content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, defamatory, or illegal under Indian law.
*   Registering for or accessing unauthorized competitive services or platforms.

#### Personal Use

Acme Corp acknowledges that employees may occasionally need to use their corporate email for limited personal purposes. Such use is permitted provided it is:

*   Infrequent and does not interfere with job duties or productivity.
*   Does not involve large attachments or excessive bandwidth consumption.
*   Does not violate any other company policies, including those related to confidentiality, data security, or acceptable use.
*   Does not imply Acme Corp's endorsement of personal views or activities.

Employees should be aware that all communications sent or received via company email are company property and may be monitored in accordance with legal and policy guidelines.

#### Email Security

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats. All users must adhere to stringent security practices to protect company data and systems:

*   **Password Management:** Create strong, unique passwords (minimum 12 characters, mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) and change them every 90 days. Never share passwords or write them down in an accessible location.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Exercise extreme caution with suspicious emails. Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown senders or if the content seems unusual, even from known contacts. Report any suspected phishing attempts immediately to the IT Security team.
*   **Data Protection:** Avoid sending sensitive company or personal data via unencrypted email. Utilize approved secure file transfer methods for such information.
*   **Device Security:** Ensure any device used to access corporate email is password-protected, has up-to-date antivirus software, and is connected to secure networks.
*   **Reporting Incidents:** Report any unauthorized access, suspicious activity, or security breaches related to your email account to the IT Security team without delay.

#### Email Signature

To maintain a consistent and professional corporate image, all outgoing emails should include a standardized signature. Employees are encouraged to use the company-approved signature format, which typically includes:

*   Employee's Full Name
*   Job Title
*   Acme Corp (with company website link)
*   Official Phone Number (optional)
*   Company Address (optional)

Images, company logos, or work-related links may be included if they align with corporate branding guidelines. Guidance on creating and implementing the official signature is available from the IT or Marketing department.

Serious breaches, particularly those involving data security, legal non-compliance, or significant reputational damage, may also lead to legal action. All incidents will be investigated thoroughly and handled consistently.
