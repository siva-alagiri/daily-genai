# Hybrid Work Model Policy

**Effective Date:** [Insert Date]

**Overview and Purpose**

At Acme Corp, we believe in empowering our 10,000-strong workforce to thrive both professionally and personally. This Hybrid Work Model Policy outlines our approach to flexible work arrangements, designed to foster a dynamic, collaborative, and high-performing environment while supporting employee well-being. We aim to leverage the benefits of both in-office collaboration and remote flexibility to enhance productivity, attract top talent, and ensure business continuity in the evolving landscape of information technology.

**Policy Framework**

**Introduction to the Flexible Work Model:**
Acme Corp recognizes the transformative power of flexible work. Our "AcmeFlex" program is a strategic initiative that provides eligible employees with options for where and how they work, promoting autonomy and adaptability. This framework supports a modern work culture that values outcomes, trust, and a balanced lifestyle.

**Policy Objectives:**
*   To enhance operational resilience and agility across all business units.
*   To strengthen our position in talent acquisition and retention within the competitive IT sector.
*   To promote a healthy work-life integration and overall employee satisfaction.
*   To foster a culture of trust, accountability, and continuous collaboration.
*   To contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing commuting impact.

**Hybrid Working Categories**

Acme Corp acknowledges that different roles and team dynamics require varied approaches to hybrid work. We define the following categories:

*   **Primarily On-site:** Roles that require a consistent physical presence at an Acme Corp office or client site for the majority of the workweek (e.g., 4-5 days). Flexibility for occasional remote work may be granted based on manager approval and business needs.
*   **Blended (Hybrid):** Roles that combine regular in-office presence with remote work. The specific cadence (e.g., 2-3 days in office per week/month) will be determined at the team level, requiring mutual agreement between the employee and their manager, aligned with team collaboration needs.
*   **Fully Remote:** Roles that are performed entirely from a remote location, with mandatory in-office attendance limited to critical team or company-wide events (e.g., quarterly reviews, annual summits) as required.

**Eligibility and Implementation**

**Eligibility Criteria:**
All roles at Acme Corp will be assessed for suitability for the AcmeFlex model based on:
*   The nature of the job responsibilities and ability to achieve performance objectives remotely.
*   The impact on team collaboration, client engagement, and project delivery.
*   The availability of necessary technology and infrastructure for secure remote operations.
Employees are encouraged to discuss their interest and role suitability with their direct manager.

**Manager Approval:**
All hybrid work arrangements under the AcmeFlex model require explicit approval from the employee's direct manager and relevant department head. This ensures alignment with team objectives, operational requirements, and equitable treatment across the organization.

**Remote Work Environment:**
Employees participating in hybrid or fully remote models are responsible for establishing a dedicated, safe, and distraction-free workspace. Acme Corp will provide guidelines on ergonomic setup and safety best practices for home offices.
