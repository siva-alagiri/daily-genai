## Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp establishes the guidelines for the appropriate and secure utilization of our corporate email systems. As email serves as a primary channel for internal and external communication, this policy aims to safeguard sensitive company information, uphold our professional reputation, and ensure efficient and respectful interactions across all stakeholders. Adherence to these guidelines is crucial for maintaining data integrity and operational security.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties granted access to Acme Corp's email systems. This includes individually assigned email accounts and shared departmental mailboxes, regardless of the device used to access them or the network connection (company or public).

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp's email system is a vital business asset designed to facilitate professional communication and collaboration. While we offer a degree of flexibility, all users are expected to exercise good judgment and prioritize business objectives.

**1. Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Users are authorized to utilize their Acme Corp email accounts for all work-related activities without undue restriction. This includes, but is not limited to:
*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and colleagues.
*   Accessing and registering for business-critical software, platforms, and services.
*   Exchanging information at industry events, conferences, and professional networking functions.
*   Subscribing to professional newsletters, industry updates, and online resources that support job functions or professional development.

**2. Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using an Acme Corp email address, users represent the company. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:
*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, defamatory, or otherwise violates Acme Corp's Code of Conduct.
*   Registering for or accessing websites, services, or platforms that are unreliable, illegal, unethical, or disreputable.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited commercial emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information without explicit authorization.
*   Engaging in political lobbying, personal commercial activities, or any other non-business-related activities that could compromise company resources or reputation.
*   Creating or transmitting chain letters, hoaxes, or other disruptive content.

**3. Personal Use**

Limited and reasonable personal use of corporate email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job responsibilities, consume excessive company resources, or violate any other company policies. Examples of acceptable personal use include:
*   Registering for educational courses or professional development events.
*   Brief communications with family and friends, ensuring no confidential information is shared.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate e-books, guides, or other content for personal learning.

**4. Email Security**

Email is a common vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Protecting our email system is paramount to maintaining company security and reputation. Users must:
*   Create and maintain strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoiding easily guessable personal information.
*   Change email passwords every 90 days or as prompted by IT security protocols.
*   Be vigilant against phishing attempts and suspicious emails. Users are instructed to:
    *   Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links from unknown or suspicious senders.
    *   Be wary of urgent or unusual requests, even if they appear to come from a known contact.
    *   Verify sender legitimacy by checking email addresses for inconsistencies or misspellings.
    *   Look for grammatical errors, excessive punctuation, or unusual formatting that may indicate a scam.
*   Report any suspicious emails or potential security incidents immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Ensure all anti-malware and security software on company-issued devices is up-to-date.

**5. Email Signature**

All professional outgoing emails should include a standardized signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand and professionalism. Users are encouraged to create a signature that includes:
*   [Your Name]
*   [Your Title], [Department]
*   Acme Corp
*   [Company Website Link]
*   [Company Phone Number] | [Company Address]

Optional additions may include company logos, relevant certifications, or links to professional social media profiles, provided they align with company branding guidelines. Assistance with signature setup is available from the IT Helpdesk or your direct supervisor.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Any violation of this Email Usage Policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may range from formal warnings to immediate termination of employment, depending on the severity and frequency of the offense. Examples of violations that may lead to severe consequences include:
*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary company information.
*   Sending or receiving inappropriate, offensive, or illegal content.
*   Using corporate email for fraudulent or unlawful activities.
*   Repeated disregard for email security protocols leading to system vulnerabilities.

All incidents will be investigated thoroughly by HR and IT, and appropriate action will be taken in accordance with company policy and applicable laws.
