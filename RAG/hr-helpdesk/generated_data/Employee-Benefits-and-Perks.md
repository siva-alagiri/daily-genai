## Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

The Acme Corp Email Usage Policy establishes clear guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of corporate email accounts by all personnel. As a leading Information Technology firm, email is a critical communication channel and a repository of valuable information. This policy is designed to ensure the integrity of our data, protect our intellectual property, maintain professional communication standards, and safeguard Acme Corp's reputation and technological infrastructure from potential threats.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, temporary staff, and any third parties who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email systems and services. This includes individual corporate email addresses and departmental shared mailboxes, regardless of the device used to access them.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Corporate email is an indispensable tool for facilitating business operations, internal collaboration, and external communication. While primarily intended for work-related purposes, Acme Corp acknowledges that limited personal use may occur, provided it adheres strictly to the principles outlined herein.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Acme Corp personnel are authorized to use their corporate email accounts for all legitimate business activities without undue restriction. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and other external stakeholders.
*   Facilitating internal team collaboration and project discussions.
*   Accessing and registering for necessary software, platforms, and online services required for job functions.
*   Professional networking and information exchange at industry events or conferences.
*   Subscribing to professional newsletters, industry updates, and educational resources relevant to professional development.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When utilizing corporate email, all users represent Acme Corp. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending or transmitting content that is insulting, discriminatory, harassing, or offensive to any individual or group.
*   Registering for or accessing unauthorized competitive services, platforms, or websites without explicit management approval.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited commercial emails (spam) or chain letters to internal or external recipients.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspicious, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information, including intellectual property, without proper authorization.
*   Engaging in any activity that violates local, national, or international laws and regulations.

**Personal Use**

Limited and occasional personal use of corporate email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job responsibilities, compromise company resources, or violate any aspect of this policy. Acceptable personal use examples include:

*   Registering for professional development courses or local community events.
*   Sending brief, non-confidential emails to friends and family.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate e-books, guides, or other content for personal interest, ensuring no impact on network performance or security.

**Email Security**

Email remains a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches, which can severely impact Acme Corp's operations, reputation, and data security. All users must exercise vigilance and adhere to the following security protocols:

*   **Password Strength**: Set strong, unique passwords of at least twelve characters, incorporating a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names).
*   **Password Management**: Do not write down passwords or share them. Utilize approved password managers if necessary.
*   **Password Rotation**: Change email passwords every 90 days. New passwords must not be identical to any of the previous five passwords.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness**: Be highly suspicious of unsolicited emails, especially those with attachments or links.
    *   Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or suspicious senders.
    *   Be wary of urgent requests, unusual sender addresses, grammatical errors, or inconsistent formatting.
    *   Verify the legitimacy of senders by checking email addresses carefully and, if in doubt, contacting the sender through an alternative, verified communication channel.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Activity**: Immediately report any suspicious emails, potential phishing attempts, or security concerns to the IT Security Department.
*   **Software Updates**: Ensure that all anti-malware and security software on devices used to access corporate email is regularly updated.

**Email Signature**

All employees are encouraged to maintain a professional and consistent email signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand identity. Sales, marketing, and executive personnel, who frequently interact with external parties, must pay special attention to their signatures. A standard format should include:

`[Your Full Name]`
`[Your Job Title], Acme Corp`
`[Company Website Link]`
`[Your Phone Number (optional)] | [Company Address]`

Company logos, approved social media links, or relevant certifications may also be included, following brand guidelines. Guidance on signature setup is available from the IT Helpdesk or your direct supervisor.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Any violation of this Email Usage Policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Examples of severe violations that may lead to immediate termination include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using corporate email for illegal activities or to facilitate fraudulent schemes.
*   Repeated or intentional disregard for email security protocols, leading to significant security incidents.

The severity of disciplinary action will be determined based on the nature, frequency, and impact of the violation on Acme Corp's operations, reputation, and legal standing.
