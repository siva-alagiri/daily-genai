## Flexible Working Hours Policy

### POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE

Acme Corp is committed to fostering a dynamic and supportive work environment that empowers our employees to achieve optimal work-life integration while maintaining high levels of productivity and operational excellence. This Flexible Working Hours Policy outlines the framework and guidelines for employees seeking to adjust their standard work schedules. Our aim is to provide flexibility where feasible, recognizing diverse personal needs and enhancing overall employee well-being and engagement.

### SCOPE

This policy applies to all permanent employees of Acme Corp. Eligibility for flexible working arrangements is determined based on the nature of the role, team requirements, business needs, and individual performance, and requires formal approval.

### POLICY COMPONENTS

We understand that employees may require variations to traditional work schedules for a multitude of reasons, including personal commitments, family responsibilities, or optimizing peak productivity times.

#### WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE FLEXIBLE WORK HOURS

Flexible working hours at Acme Corp can encompass various arrangements, subject to role suitability and management approval:

*   **Flextime:** Employees can adjust their daily start and end times, provided they complete their contracted hours and are available during designated "core hours" for team collaboration and client interactions.
*   **Compressed Workweek:** Employees may work their total weekly hours in fewer than five days (e.g., four 10-hour days), allowing for an additional day off.
*   **Staggered Hours:** Different start and end times are adopted by team members to ensure continuous coverage and optimize workflow, particularly for roles requiring extended availability.
*   **Hybrid/Remote Work Integration:** For roles approved for hybrid or remote work, flexible hours can be integrated to align with individual and team schedules, respecting core collaboration times.

When evaluating requests for flexible work arrangements, the following factors will be carefully considered:

*   **Role Requirements:** The inherent demands of the position, including client-facing responsibilities, project deadlines, and the need for on-site presence.
*   **Team and Departmental Impact:** Ensuring that the proposed arrangement does not negatively affect team collaboration, project timelines, or the ability of other team members to perform their duties.
*   **Client and Business Needs:** Maintaining seamless service delivery and responsiveness to our clients and business partners.
*   **Employee Performance:** A consistent record of strong performance and adherence to company policies.
*   **Technology and Infrastructure:** The ability to effectively perform duties with the available technological resources, especially for remote components.

#### PROCEDURE

Employees wishing to request a flexible working arrangement must follow these steps:

1.  **Initial Discussion:** The employee should first discuss their interest and proposed flexible schedule with their immediate manager, outlining the rationale and how their responsibilities will continue to be met.
2.  **Formal Request Submission:** A formal request must be submitted to the HR department via the designated HR portal, detailing the type of flexible arrangement sought, proposed hours, and the anticipated duration. This request should clearly articulate how the employee plans to manage their workload and maintain team and client communication.
3.  **Managerial Review:** The immediate manager will review the formal request, assessing its feasibility against the factors outlined above. The manager may engage in further discussions with the employee to refine the proposal.
4.  **HR and Leadership Approval:** The manager will forward their recommendation, along with the employee's request, to the HR department for final review and approval by relevant departmental leadership.
5.  **Agreement Documentation:** If approved, a formal agreement outlining the terms, conditions, and duration of the flexible working arrangement will be prepared by HR and signed by the employee and their manager. This document will specify expectations regarding availability, communication, and performance metrics.
6.  **Review and Reassessment:** All flexible working arrangements will be subject to periodic review (e.g., annually or as business needs change) to ensure continued effectiveness and alignment with organizational goals. If an arrangement proves detrimental to individual or team performance, or business operations, it may be subject to modification or termination.
