## Company Email Usage Policy

### POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE

This policy outlines the expectations and guidelines for the appropriate use of company email accounts at Acme Corp. Our corporate email system is a critical communication tool and a valuable asset. This policy aims to ensure secure, professional, and efficient communication, protect sensitive company information, and uphold Acme Corp's reputation and legal standing.

### SCOPE

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties granted access to Acme Corp's email systems, whether individually assigned or departmental. Adherence is required regardless of location or device used to access company email.

### COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY

Acme Corp's email system is provided to facilitate business operations and professional communication. While employees are granted some flexibility for personal use, all usage must align with company values and legal obligations.

#### Correct Use of Corporate Email

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email addresses for all work-related activities, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and colleagues for business purposes.
*   Accessing and utilizing company-approved software and online services necessary for job functions.
*   Representing Acme Corp professionally in external correspondence and official events.
*   Subscribing to industry newsletters, professional development resources, or platforms that enhance job performance or personal growth, provided they are relevant and secure.

#### Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email

When using an Acme Corp email, employees act as representatives of the company. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending, forwarding, or storing content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, defamatory, or sexually explicit.
*   Registering for or accessing websites, services, or applications that are unreliable, illegal, or disreputable, or that could compromise company security.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Engaging in any activity that violates local, national, or international laws, including copyright infringement or distribution of illegal material.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information without explicit authorization.
*   Using email for personal financial gain, political lobbying, or extensive non-business-related activities that could interfere with work duties or company resources.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all corporate email communications for compliance with this policy and for security purposes.

#### Personal Use

Limited and reasonable personal use of company email is permitted, provided it does not:

*   Interfere with job performance or productivity.
*   Involve the disclosure of confidential company information.
*   Violate any other company policies or legal regulations.
*   Involve excessive bandwidth consumption or storage.

Examples of acceptable personal use include:

*   Brief communications with family and friends that are non-disruptive and do not contain sensitive information.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate e-books, guides, or other content for personal interest, ensuring no impact on company systems.

#### Email Security

Email remains a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Employees must exercise vigilance to protect company and personal data.

Employees are required to:

*   Create and maintain strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoiding easily guessable personal information.
*   Change email passwords every 90 days or as prompted by IT security protocols.
*   Report any suspicious emails, phishing attempts, or security incidents immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Be cautious when opening attachments or clicking on links from unknown or suspicious senders.
*   Verify the legitimacy of senders by checking email addresses and looking for inconsistencies (e.g., grammatical errors, excessive punctuation, unusual requests).
*   Ensure that anti-malware and antivirus software on company-issued devices is up-to-date.

#### Email Signature

Employees are encouraged to use a professional and standardized email signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand identity. The signature should include:

*   Employee's Full Name
*   Job Title
*   Acme Corp (with official company link)
*   Official Company Phone Number (if applicable)
*   Company Address

Employees may include company logos, approved social media links, or work-related videos as per brand guidelines. Guidance on creating or updating email signatures can be obtained from the Marketing or IT department.
