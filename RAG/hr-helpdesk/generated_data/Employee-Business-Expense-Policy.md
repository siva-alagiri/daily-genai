**Acme Corp Cyber Security Policy**

**Policy Brief & Purpose**

Acme Corp's Cyber Security Policy establishes comprehensive guidelines and provisions to safeguard our digital assets, information infrastructure, and proprietary data. In an increasingly interconnected digital landscape, protecting our systems from evolving cyber threats is paramount to maintaining business continuity, client trust, and regulatory compliance. This policy aims to cultivate a security-conscious culture among all personnel and mitigate risks associated with information technology.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, interns, and any third parties who access, process, or manage Acme Corp's information systems, networks, or data, regardless of their location or the device used.

**Policy Elements**

**Confidential Data**

Confidential data at Acme Corp includes, but is not limited to:
*   Client-specific data, intellectual property, and project details.
*   Proprietary software code, algorithms, and development plans.
*   Unpublished financial reports, strategic business plans, and market research.
*   Employee personal information (e.g., PII, payroll data).
*   Sensitive communications and internal memos.

All personnel are obligated to protect this data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

**Protect Personal and Company Devices**

All devices used to access Acme Corp resources (company-issued or personal) must adhere to the following:
*   **Password Protection:** All devices must be secured with strong, unique passwords, PINs, or biometric authentication.
*   **Antivirus/Anti-Malware:** Up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware software must be installed and actively running on all company-issued devices. Personal devices accessing company data are strongly encouraged to do the same.
*   **Physical Security:** Devices must never be left unattended in public spaces and should be secured when not in use.
*   **Software Updates:** Operating systems, applications, and browsers must be kept updated with the latest security patches.
*   **Network Access:** Access to company accounts and systems should only occur over secure, trusted networks. Public Wi-Fi should be used with extreme caution and preferably with a company-approved VPN.

New hires receiving company-issued equipment will be provided with instructions for disk encryption, password management tool setup, and installation of security software.

**Keep Emails Safe**

Emails are a primary vector for cyber threats. To prevent phishing, malware, and data breaches:
*   **Suspicious Emails:** Do not open attachments or click links in emails from unknown senders or if the content seems unusual or unexpected, even from known contacts.
*   **Phishing Indicators:** Be vigilant for common phishing signs such as generic greetings, urgent requests, grammatical errors, unusual sender addresses, or requests for sensitive information.
*   **Verification:** If an email requests sensitive information or action, verify the sender's identity through an alternative, trusted communication channel (e.g., phone call).

Report any suspicious emails to the IT Security team immediately.

**Manage Passwords Properly**

Strong password practices are crucial for system integrity:
*   **Complexity:** Passwords must be at least 12 characters long, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid easily guessable information.
*   **Uniqueness:** Do not reuse passwords across different accounts, especially for company systems.
*   **Confidentiality:** Never share passwords. If a password must be temporarily shared for legitimate business reasons, use a secure method and change it immediately afterward.
*   **Rotation:** Passwords for critical systems must be changed every 90 days.
*   **Password Manager:** Utilize the company-provided password management tool for generating and securely storing complex passwords.

**Transfer Data Securely**

Secure data transfer is essential to prevent unauthorized access:
*   **Sensitive Data:** Avoid transferring sensitive data (e.g., client lists, proprietary code) to personal devices or unauthorized cloud storage.
*   **Approved Channels:** Use only company-approved secure file transfer protocols, encrypted drives, or internal network shares for sharing confidential information.
*   **External Sharing:** When sharing data externally, ensure the recipient is authorized and that appropriate security measures (e.g., encryption, access controls) are in place.

**Report Scams, Privacy Breaches and Hacking Attempts**

Prompt reporting is vital for rapid response and mitigation:
*   **Immediate Notification:** Any suspected security incident, data breach, phishing attempt, or system vulnerability must be reported immediately to the IT Security team.
*   **Incident Response:** The IT Security team will investigate all reports, take necessary corrective actions, and communicate relevant information to affected parties.

**Additional Measures**

Acme Corp's IT Security team will:
*   Implement and maintain robust firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and access authentication mechanisms.
*   Conduct regular security awareness training for all employees.
*   Provide timely alerts and guidance on emerging cyber threats.
*   Perform periodic security audits and vulnerability assessments.
*   Ensure all physical and digital infrastructure is protected.

All employees are expected to:
*   Lock their screens when stepping away from their workstations.
*   Report lost or stolen company equipment to IT and HR immediately.
*   Refrain from installing unauthorized software on company devices.
*   Avoid accessing suspicious or unapproved websites.

**Remote Employees**

Remote employees must adhere to all aspects of this policy. They are responsible for ensuring their home network is secure (e.g., strong Wi-Fi password, updated router firmware) and that their workspace is private to prevent unauthorized viewing of sensitive information. Use of company-provided VPN is mandatory for accessing internal resources.

**Disciplinary Action**

Compliance with this policy is mandatory. Violations will be subject to disciplinary action, which may range from formal warnings and mandatory retraining to suspension or termination of employment, depending on the severity, intent, and impact of the breach. Legal action may also be pursued in cases of gross negligence or malicious intent, especially involving data theft or significant harm to Acme Corp.
