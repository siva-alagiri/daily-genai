# Acme Corp Email Usage Policy

## POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE

This policy establishes guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of corporate email accounts by Acme Corp employees. It aims to protect company information, maintain professional communication standards, and ensure compliance with data security protocols, thereby safeguarding our reputation and technological assets.

## SCOPE

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email systems, whether individually or departmentally.

## COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY

Acme Corp's email system is a vital communication tool provided to facilitate business operations. While employees are granted reasonable flexibility, its primary purpose is professional communication.

### Correct Use of Corporate Email

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email for all work-related activities, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, and internal teams.
*   Accessing and utilizing approved software and online services essential for job functions.
*   Exchanging information at professional conferences, industry events, or for business development.
*   Subscribing to professional newsletters or platforms that support career growth and job performance.

### Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email

When utilizing corporate email, employees represent Acme Corp. Therefore, they must not:

*   Transmit content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or otherwise violates company policies or legal standards.
*   Register for services or platforms that are directly competitive with Acme Corp's business without explicit authorization.
*   Engage in unsolicited mass emailing (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Sign up for unreliable, illegal, or disrereputable websites or services.
*   Distribute unlawful marketing materials or solicitations.
*   Disclose confidential or proprietary company information to unauthorized parties.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email usage for compliance with this policy and to ensure system security.

### Personal Use

Limited and reasonable personal use of corporate email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job duties, violate company policies, or compromise security. Examples include:

*   Registering for educational courses or professional networking events.
*   Brief communications with friends and family, ensuring no confidential information is shared and no spamming occurs.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate guides, e-books, or content for personal development.

### Email Security

Email remains a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Employees are critical to maintaining email security and must:

*   Create strong, unique passwords of at least eight characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, avoiding personal information.
*   Memorize passwords rather than writing them down.
*   Change email passwords every four to six months.
*   Exercise extreme caution with suspicious emails:
    *   Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or unexpected senders.
    *   Be wary of urgent or enticing "clickbait" titles.
    *   Verify sender names and email addresses for legitimacy, looking for subtle inconsistencies.
    *   Identify stylistic red flags such as grammatical errors, excessive punctuation, or unusual formatting.
*   Report any suspicious emails or potential security incidents immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Ensure personal anti-malware and antivirus software on personal devices used for work is up-to-date.

### Email Signature

Employees are encouraged to maintain a professional email signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand identity. This typically includes:

*   Employee Name
*   Job Title, Department
*   Acme Corp [with company website link]
*   Contact Phone Number (optional)
*   Company Address (optional)

Company logos, approved images, and links to work-related content may also be included. Guidance on creating and implementing standard signatures is available from the Marketing or IT department.

## DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES

Violations of this Email Usage Policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Examples of severe violations include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary company information.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using corporate email for illegal activities.
*   Repeated or intentional disregard for email security protocols.

The severity of disciplinary action will be determined based on the nature, frequency, and impact of the violation.
