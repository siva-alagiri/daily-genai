# Work-From-Home Policy

**Effective Date:** October 26, 2023

## 1. Purpose:

This Work-From-Home (WFH) Policy at Acme Corp establishes the framework and expectations for employees authorized to perform their duties remotely. Our objective is to foster a flexible work environment that supports employee well-being, enhances productivity, and ensures business continuity, particularly for our large and geographically dispersed Information Technology workforce. This policy aims to provide clear guidelines for remote work arrangements while maintaining operational efficiency and data security standards.

## 2. Eligibility:

Eligibility for remote work under this policy is determined by Acme Corp based on the nature of the role, job responsibilities, and the employee's consistent performance record. Roles requiring a high degree of physical presence, specialized on-site equipment, or direct client interaction may not be eligible. All full-time employees who have successfully completed their probationary period and consistently meet performance expectations may be considered.

## 3. Approval Process:

Employees interested in a WFH arrangement must submit a formal request to their immediate supervisor, outlining the proposed schedule and rationale. The supervisor, in consultation with the Human Resources department, will review the request based on business needs, team dynamics, and the employee's suitability for remote work. Final approval rests with the department head and HR, ensuring fairness and consistency across the organization.

## 4. Equipment and Security:

Acme Corp will provide necessary company-issued equipment (e.g., laptops, monitors) and secure access to company networks and applications for approved remote work. Employees are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of all company information and assets, adhering strictly to Acme Corp's cybersecurity protocols. This includes using secure internet connections and ensuring physical security of equipment and data in their remote workspace.

## 5. Work Hours:

Remote employees are expected to adhere to their agreed-upon work hours and maintain availability during core business hours as defined by their team and manager. Any deviations from the standard work schedule, including requests for overtime, must be pre-approved by the supervisor. All working hours must be accurately recorded in the designated time-tracking system, in compliance with Indian labor laws.

## 6. Communication:

Maintaining effective communication is paramount for remote teams. Employees working remotely must proactively communicate with their supervisors and team members through company-approved channels (e.g., Microsoft Teams, email, video conferencing). Regular check-ins, participation in virtual meetings, and timely responses to communications are expected to ensure seamless collaboration.

## 7. Productivity and Performance:

Performance expectations for remote employees are identical to those for in-office employees. Managers will conduct regular performance reviews and provide feedback to ensure accountability and productivity. Employees are expected to manage their time effectively, meet deadlines, and deliver high-quality work, irrespective of their work location.

## 8. Health and Safety:

Employees are responsible for establishing a safe and ergonomically sound workspace at their remote location. Acme Corp encourages employees to take regular breaks and maintain a healthy work-life balance. While Acme Corp is committed to employee well-being, the company is not liable for injuries that occur at the employee's remote workspace that are not directly related to work activities or company-provided equipment.

## 9. Expenses:

Acme Corp will reimburse approved business expenses directly related to remote work, such as a portion of internet connectivity costs or specific office supplies, in accordance with the company's expense reimbursement policy. Employees must submit expense claims with valid receipts through the designated system. Personal utility costs (e.g., electricity) are generally not reimbursed unless explicitly approved for specific roles or circumstances.

## 10. Termination of Remote Work Agreement:

Acme Corp reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate any remote work arrangement at any time, with or without notice, based on business needs, changes in job responsibilities, or performance concerns. Employees will be provided with reasonable notice where feasible.

## 11. Confidentiality:

All remote employees must strictly adhere to Acme Corp's confidentiality and data protection policies. Unauthorized disclosure, access, or use of sensitive company, client, or employee information is strictly prohibited and may result in severe disciplinary action, including termination of employment and legal proceedings.

## 12. Compliance:

Remote employees must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations in India, as well as all Acme Corp policies and procedures, while working remotely. This includes adherence to IT security policies, code of conduct, and anti-harassment guidelines.

## 13. Acknowledgment:

By participating in the WFH program, employees acknowledge their understanding and agreement to comply with all terms and conditions outlined in this policy.

## 14. Review and Updates:

This policy will be reviewed periodically, at least annually, and updated as needed to reflect changes in business operations, technology, or legal requirements. Employees will be informed of any changes through official company communication channels.

## 15. Contact Information:

For any questions or concerns regarding this Work-From-Home policy, employees should contact the Human Resources department.
