## Acme Corp Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

The Acme Corp Email Usage Policy establishes clear guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of corporate email accounts by all personnel. As a leading Information Technology company, email is a critical communication and collaboration tool, and its responsible use is paramount to maintaining our professional reputation, protecting sensitive data, and ensuring operational efficiency. This policy aims to safeguard company information from unauthorized access, misuse, and cyber threats, while fostering a culture of professional and ethical digital communication.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, and any third parties granted access to or assigned an Acme Corp email address, whether individually or departmentally. This includes email accessed via company-issued devices, personal devices, or any network, regardless of physical location.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Corporate email is a vital asset for Acme Corp, facilitating internal and external communication. While we grant flexibility for reasonable personal use, the primary purpose of company email is for business-related activities.

**1. Appropriate Use of Corporate Email**

Acme Corp personnel are authorized to use their company email for all legitimate business purposes, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and colleagues.
*   Accessing and registering for business-critical software, platforms, and services.
*   Professional networking and engagement at industry events.
*   Subscribing to industry newsletters, research, and professional development resources relevant to their role.

**2. Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using an Acme Corp email address, individuals represent the company. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, defamatory, or illegal.
*   Registering for or accessing services that are competitive with Acme Corp's business, unless explicitly authorized by senior management.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, or disreputable websites or services that could compromise company security or reputation.
*   Distributing unlawful marketing materials, chain letters, or solicitations.
*   Sharing confidential or proprietary company information without proper authorization.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all corporate email communications for compliance with this policy and for security purposes.

**3. Personal Use**

Employees may use their corporate email for limited personal activities, provided it does not interfere with job duties, compromise company security, or violate any other company policies. Acceptable personal use includes:

*   Registering for personal development courses or professional meetups.
*   Brief communications with friends and family, ensuring no confidential information is disclosed.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate personal content (e.g., e-books, guides) that does not pose a security risk.

**4. Email Security**

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Protecting our email system is critical to maintaining data integrity and business continuity. All users must adhere to the following security protocols:

*   **Password Management:**
    *   Set strong, unique passwords of at least eight characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    *   Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names) in passwords.
    *   Change email passwords every 90 days.
    *   Never write down or share passwords.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:**
    *   Exercise extreme caution with attachments and links from unknown or suspicious senders.
    *   Be wary of emails with urgent or enticing subject lines (clickbait).
    *   Verify sender identities by checking email addresses and names for legitimacy.
    *   Look for stylistic inconsistencies, grammatical errors, or unusual formatting that may indicate a phishing attempt.
    *   Report any suspicious emails immediately to the IT Security team.
*   **Anti-Malware:** Ensure company-provided anti-malware software is active and up-to-date on all devices used to access company email.

**5. Email Signature**

All professional email communications should include a standardized signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand and professionalism. Employees are encouraged to use the following format:

`[Your Full Name]`
`[Your Job Title], [Your Department]`
`Acme Corp`
`[Company Website Link]`
`[Your Direct Phone Number (Optional)] | [Company Address (Optional)]`

Company logos or approved professional images may be included. For assistance with signature setup, please contact your direct supervisor or the IT Helpdesk.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Violation of this Email Usage Policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, depending on the severity and frequency of the offense. Examples of violations that may lead to disciplinary action include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary company information via email.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using corporate email for illegal activities or to facilitate fraudulent schemes.
*   Repeated failure to follow email security protocols, leading to system vulnerabilities or breaches.

Acme Corp will investigate all reported violations thoroughly and impartially.
