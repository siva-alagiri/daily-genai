# Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

The Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp is designed to establish clear guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of corporate email addresses. As a leading Information Technology firm, email is a critical communication channel and a repository of valuable information. This policy ensures that all digital communications uphold our professional standards, protect sensitive company data, and safeguard our reputation and technological infrastructure.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties who are assigned or granted access to an Acme Corp email address, whether individually or as part of a department. This includes access via company-issued devices or personal devices used for work purposes.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Corporate email is a fundamental tool for facilitating business operations and collaboration within Acme Corp. While we trust our employees to exercise good judgment, this policy clarifies acceptable and unacceptable practices.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email for all legitimate work-related activities, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and colleagues.
*   Registering for industry-specific software, platforms, or services essential for job functions.
*   Exchanging professional information at conferences, workshops, or networking events.
*   Subscribing to professional newsletters, technical journals, or online resources that enhance job knowledge and skills.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When utilizing an Acme Corp email address, employees are representing the company. Therefore, they must refrain from:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or derogatory.
*   Registering for services or platforms that are competitive with Acme Corp's business without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspicious, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Distributing unlawful marketing materials, chain letters, or solicitations.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information without proper authorization.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email communications for compliance with this policy and legal obligations.

**Personal Use**

Limited and reasonable personal use of corporate email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job duties, compromise company resources, or violate any other company policies. Examples include:

*   Registering for educational courses or professional development meetups.
*   Sending brief, non-disruptive communications to friends and family, ensuring no confidential information is shared.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate guides, e-books, or content for personal learning that does not consume excessive bandwidth or storage.

**Email Security**

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Protecting our email system is crucial for maintaining Acme Corp's integrity, security, and reputation. Employees must:

*   Create and maintain strong, unique passwords of at least twelve characters, incorporating a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, avoiding personal information. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory where implemented.
*   Change email passwords every 90 days or as prompted by IT security protocols.
*   Be vigilant against phishing attempts and suspicious emails. Employees are instructed to:
    *   Never open attachments or click on links from unknown or suspicious senders.
    *   Exercise caution with urgent or enticing subject lines (clickbait).
    *   Verify sender addresses and names for legitimacy, looking for subtle misspellings or inconsistencies.
    *   Identify stylistic red flags such as grammatical errors, excessive punctuation, or unusual formatting.
*   Report any suspicious emails or perceived security threats immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Ensure their anti-malware and antivirus software on company-issued devices is always updated and active.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to use a professional and consistent email signature that accurately represents Acme Corp. This is particularly important for individuals who communicate externally with clients and partners. A standard format should include:

`[Employee Name]`
`[Employee Title], [Department]`
`Acme Corp | [Company Website Link]`
`[Phone Number] | [Company Address]`

Company logos or approved professional images may be included. Guidance on setting up and maintaining email signatures can be obtained from the Marketing or IT departments.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Any employee found to be in violation of this Email Usage Policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include, but is not limited to, verbal warnings, written reprimands, suspension, or termination of employment. The severity of the disciplinary action will depend on the nature and impact of the violation.

Examples of violations that may lead to severe disciplinary action, including termination, include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential company information via email.
*   Sending or forwarding inappropriate, offensive, or harassing content to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using a corporate email address for illegal activities.
*   Repeated disregard for email security protocols, leading to security incidents.
