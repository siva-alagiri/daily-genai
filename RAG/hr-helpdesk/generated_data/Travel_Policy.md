## Company Email Usage Policy

### POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE

This Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp establishes the guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of company-provided email accounts and systems. As a leading Information Technology firm, email is a fundamental communication channel, and this policy ensures that its use upholds our professional standards, protects sensitive information, and maintains the integrity of our digital infrastructure. Our objective is to facilitate effective business communication while safeguarding company assets, reputation, and compliance with data protection regulations in India.

### SCOPE

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third-party personnel who are provided with or have access to Acme Corp's email systems, whether for individual or departmental use, regardless of their physical location or device used.

### COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY

Acme Corp's email system is a vital business tool intended primarily for professional communications. While limited personal use is permitted, all users must adhere to the principles outlined below.

#### Correct Use of Corporate Email

Employees are authorized to use their company email for all legitimate business purposes, including but not limited to:
*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and colleagues.
*   Accessing and utilizing approved business applications and services.
*   Participating in professional development activities, webinars, or industry forums relevant to their role.
*   Receiving official company communications and updates.

#### Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email

When utilizing company email, users are representatives of Acme Corp. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:
*   Sending, forwarding, or storing content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or illegal under Indian law.
*   Registering for or accessing websites, services, or applications that are unauthorized, unreliable, or pose a security risk.
*   Engaging in unsolicited commercial emailing (spamming) or chain letters.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company, client, or employee information without explicit authorization.
*   Using email for personal financial gain, political campaigning, or any activity that conflicts with company interests.
*   Impersonating others or sending emails under false pretenses.

#### Personal Use

Limited and reasonable personal use of company email is permitted, provided it does not:
*   Interfere with job performance or productivity.
*   Involve the transmission or storage of large files that consume excessive network resources.
*   Violate any other aspect of this policy, including security and confidentiality guidelines.
*   Disclose any confidential company information.

#### Email Security

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats. All users must exercise vigilance to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and malware.
*   **Password Management:** Set strong, unique passwords (minimum 12 characters, mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) where required. Passwords must be changed every 90 days.
*   **Phishing and Malware:** Be cautious of suspicious emails. Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown senders or if the content seems unusual, even from known contacts. Report any suspected phishing attempts immediately to the IT Security team.
*   **Data Handling:** Avoid sending sensitive or confidential information via unencrypted email. Use approved secure file transfer methods for such data.
*   **Device Security:** Ensure all devices used to access company email are protected with up-to-date antivirus software, firewalls, and operating system patches.

#### Email Signature

All official external communications should include a standardized email signature to maintain professional branding and provide necessary contact information.
*   The signature should include the employee's full name, job title, department, company name, and official contact details.
*   Company logos or approved marketing taglines may be included.
*   Personal quotes, external links, or non-business-related content are not permitted in official signatures. Guidance on signature setup is available from the IT department.

Serious breaches, particularly those involving data security, confidentiality, or illegal activities, may also lead to legal action.
