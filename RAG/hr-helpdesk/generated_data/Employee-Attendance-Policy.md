# Information Security Policy

**Purpose**

Acme Corp is committed to safeguarding its digital assets, intellectual property, and sensitive information. This Information Security Policy establishes the framework for protecting our data and technology infrastructure from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Our aim is to maintain the trust of our clients and employees, ensure business continuity, and comply with all applicable regulatory requirements in India.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, and any third parties who access or manage Acme Corp's systems, networks, or data, regardless of their location or the device used.

**Policy Elements**

**Confidential Data**

Confidential data at Acme Corp is defined as any information that is not publicly available and whose unauthorized disclosure could cause harm to the company, its clients, or its employees. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Client data, including personally identifiable information (PII) and financial records.
*   Proprietary software code, algorithms, and development plans.
*   Project specifications, technical designs, and unreleased product information.
*   Internal financial statements, strategic business plans, and marketing strategies.
*   Employee personal data and human resources records.

All personnel are obligated to protect this data and handle it with the utmost care and discretion.

**Protect Personal and Company Devices**

When accessing Acme Corp resources, all devices, whether company-issued or personal (under BYOD policy), must adhere to the following security standards:

*   **Password Protection:** All devices must be secured with strong, unique passwords or biometric authentication.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA is mandatory for accessing all critical company systems and applications.
*   **Antivirus/Anti-Malware:** Ensure up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware software is installed and actively running.
*   **Disk Encryption:** Company-issued laptops and mobile devices must have full disk encryption enabled (e.g., BitLocker, FileVault).
*   **Physical Security:** Devices must not be left unattended in unsecured locations.
*   **Network Access:** Only connect to secure and trusted networks when accessing company data. Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks unless using a company-approved VPN.
*   **Software Installation:** Unauthorized software installation on company-issued devices is strictly prohibited.
*   **New Hire Setup:** New employees will receive specific instructions from the IT department for configuring and securing their devices upon onboarding.

**Keep Emails Safe**

Email remains a primary vector for cyber threats. Employees must exercise extreme caution and vigilance:

*   **Phishing Awareness:** Be suspicious of unsolicited emails, especially those requesting personal information, login credentials, or financial details.
*   **Attachment & Link Caution:** Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or suspicious senders, or if the content seems unusual or out of context, even from known contacts.
*   **Sender Verification:** Always verify the sender's identity for unusual requests (e.g., urgent financial transfers, password resets) by contacting them through an alternative, verified channel.
*   **Report Suspicious Emails:** Immediately report any suspicious emails to the IT Security Operations Center (SOC) using the designated reporting mechanism.
*   **Social Engineering:** Be aware of social engineering tactics designed to trick you into revealing information or performing actions.

**Manage Passwords Properly**

Robust password practices are fundamental to information security:

*   **Strength & Uniqueness:** Create strong, unique passwords for each account, consisting of at least 12 characters, including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
*   **Password Manager:** Utilize the company-approved password manager to store and generate complex passwords.
*   **Confidentiality:** Never share your passwords with anyone, including colleagues or IT support.
*   **Regular Changes:** Change passwords for critical systems every 90 days.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable and use MFA for all corporate accounts where available.

**Transfer Data Securely**

Data transfer must always prioritize security and confidentiality:

*   **Approved Channels:** Use only approved, encrypted channels and platforms for transferring sensitive or confidential company data (e.g., secure file transfer protocols, company-provided cloud storage with appropriate access controls, VPNs).
*   **Public Cloud/Personal Email:** Strictly prohibit the use of public cloud storage services or personal email accounts for storing or transmitting company confidential data.
*   **Recipient Verification:** Always verify the authorization and identity of the recipient before sharing sensitive information.
*   **Data Classification:** Adhere to Acme Corp's data classification guidelines when handling and transferring data of varying sensitivity levels.

**Report Scams, Privacy Breaches and Hacking Attempts**

Prompt reporting is crucial for effective incident response:

*   **Mandatory Reporting:** All employees are required to immediately report any suspected security incidents, data breaches, privacy violations, or unusual system behavior to the IT Security Operations Center (SOC).
*   **Reporting Channels:** Use the designated internal channels (e.g., dedicated email, ticketing system, or emergency hotline) for reporting.
*   **"When in Doubt, Report It":** If you are unsure whether an event constitutes a security incident, it is always better to report it.
*   **Investigation:** The IT SOC will investigate all reported incidents promptly and thoroughly.

**Additional Measures**

**IT Security Team Responsibilities:**

*   Deploy and maintain robust network security controls, including firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and secure gateways.
*   Conduct regular vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and security audits of systems and applications.
*   Provide mandatory, comprehensive security awareness training for all employees annually, covering evolving threats and best practices.
*   Continuously monitor network traffic, system logs, and security alerts for anomalies and potential threats.
*   Develop, maintain, and regularly test incident response and disaster recovery plans.

**Employee Responsibilities:**

*   **Workstation Security:** Always lock your workstation when stepping away from your desk.
*   **Device Reporting:** Report lost or stolen company-issued devices to the IT SOC immediately.
*   **Clean Desk Policy:** Adhere to a clean desk policy to protect physical documents and removable media.
*   **Unauthorized Software:** Do not download or install unauthorized software on company devices or networks.
*   **Web Browsing:** Avoid accessing non-business-related, suspicious, or illegal websites on company networks or devices.

**Remote Employees**

All elements of this policy apply equally to employees working remotely. Additionally, remote employees must:

*   **Home Network Security:** Ensure their home Wi-Fi networks are secured with strong passwords and updated router firmware.
*   **VPN Usage:** Use the company-provided Virtual Private Network (VPN) for all access to internal Acme Corp resources and data.
*   **Secure Workspace:** Maintain a dedicated and physically secure workspace, free from unauthorized access or viewing, especially when handling sensitive information.
*   **Physical Device Security:** Ensure the physical security of company devices in remote locations.

**Disciplinary Action**

Acme Corp takes information security seriously. Any violation of this policy, whether intentional or unintentional, will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and potential legal action, depending on the severity of the breach and its impact on the company. Employees found to be negligent in their security responsibilities will also face progressive disciplinary measures.
