**Acme Corp Email Usage Policy**

**Policy Brief & Purpose**

This Acme Corp Email Usage Policy establishes the guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of company-provided email accounts. As a leading Information Technology firm, email is a critical communication and collaboration tool, and its responsible use is paramount to safeguarding our proprietary information, maintaining our professional reputation, and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations in India.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, and any third-party personnel granted access to Acme Corp's email systems, whether individually assigned or departmental accounts. Adherence is required regardless of location or device used to access company email.

**Components of the Policy**

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Acme Corp email accounts are provided primarily for business-related communications and activities. Employees are authorized to use their company email for tasks such as:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, and internal teams regarding project work, business development, and operational matters.
*   Accessing company-licensed software, platforms, and internal systems.
*   Professional networking at industry events, conferences, and webinars.
*   Subscribing to professional newsletters, industry updates, and educational resources relevant to their role and professional development.
*   Any other activity directly supporting Acme Corp's business objectives.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

Employees represent Acme Corp when using their corporate email. Therefore, the following uses are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, defamatory, or sexually explicit.
*   Registering for or accessing services related to competitors without explicit management approval.
*   Engaging in spamming, chain letters, or unsolicited mass emails.
*   Signing up for or accessing illegal, unreliable, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Distributing unlawful marketing materials, solicitations, or political endorsements.
*   Sharing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company or client information externally without proper authorization.
*   Any activity that violates Indian laws or regulations, or Acme Corp's Code of Conduct.

**Personal Use**

Limited and reasonable personal use of corporate email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with work duties, consume excessive company resources, or violate any other company policies. Acceptable personal uses include:

*   Registering for professional development courses or industry meetups.
*   Brief communications with friends and family, ensuring no confidential information is shared and it does not constitute spam.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate personal content (e.g., e-books, guides) that does not pose a security risk or consume significant bandwidth.

Employees should be aware that all communications and data on company systems are subject to monitoring by Acme Corp.

**Email Security**

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Protecting our email system is critical for Acme Corp's operational integrity and data security. Employees must adhere to the following security protocols:

*   **Password Management:** Use strong, unique passwords (minimum 12 characters, combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) for all company accounts, including email. Passwords must not contain personal information and should be changed every 90 days. Do not write down or share passwords.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Exercise extreme caution with suspicious emails. Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or untrusted senders. Verify the legitimacy of senders, especially for unexpected requests or urgent messages. Look for grammatical errors, unusual formatting, or generic greetings.
*   **Reporting:** Immediately report any suspicious emails, potential phishing attempts, or security incidents to the IT Security team.
*   **Software Updates:** Ensure all company-issued devices used for email access have up-to-date antivirus software and operating system security patches.
*   **Confidential Information:** Avoid sending sensitive client data, proprietary code, or personal employee information via email unless encrypted or through approved secure channels.

**Email Signature**

A consistent and professional email signature is essential for maintaining Acme Corp's brand image. All employees are required to use the standard corporate email signature template provided by the Marketing or IT department. This template typically includes:

*   Employee's Full Name
*   Job Title
*   Acme Corp (with company website link)
*   Company Phone Number (optional)
*   Company Address
*   Company Logo (as per brand guidelines)

No personal quotes, external links, or unapproved images should be included. Guidance on signature setup is available from the IT Helpdesk.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Violations of this Email Usage Policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, depending on the severity and frequency of the infraction. Examples of serious violations include, but are not limited to:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential company or client data.
*   Engaging in illegal activities or sending unlawful content.
*   Persistent sending of offensive, harassing, or discriminatory communications.
*   Repeated disregard for email security protocols leading to system compromise.
*   Any action that causes significant reputational damage or financial loss to Acme Corp.
