# Acme Corp Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp outlines the expectations and guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of the company's email system and associated services. As a leading Information Technology firm, email is a fundamental communication channel, and its responsible use is paramount to maintaining our professional image, protecting sensitive information, and ensuring operational efficiency. This policy aims to safeguard company data from breaches, uphold our reputation, and protect our technological infrastructure.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, and any third parties who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email accounts, whether individual or departmental. This includes access from company-issued devices or personal devices used for work purposes.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp's email system is a vital business tool provided to facilitate work-related communications. While we offer a degree of flexibility for limited personal use, all users are expected to prioritize business objectives and adhere to professional standards.

**1. Acceptable Use**

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email accounts for all legitimate business purposes without undue restriction. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and colleagues regarding company business.
*   Accessing and utilizing approved software, platforms, and online services necessary for job functions.
*   Exchanging professional information at conferences, industry events, or networking opportunities.
*   Subscribing to industry newsletters, professional development resources, or technical forums relevant to their role and growth.

**2. Prohibited Use**

When utilizing Acme Corp email, users are representatives of the company. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, defamatory, or sexually explicit.
*   Registering for or accessing competitive services or platforms without explicit authorization from management.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspicious, or disreputable websites or services that could compromise company security or reputation.
*   Transmitting unlawful marketing information, chain letters, or unauthorized solicitations.
*   Sharing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information with unauthorized individuals or entities.
*   Engaging in any activity that violates local, national, or international laws and regulations.

**3. Personal Use**

Limited and reasonable personal use of company email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job duties, consume excessive company resources, or violate any other aspect of this policy. Examples of acceptable personal use include:

*   Registering for educational courses, professional meetups, or personal development workshops.
*   Sending brief, non-disruptive emails to friends and family, ensuring no confidential information is disclosed.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate guides, e-books, or content for personal interest that does not pose a security risk.

**4. Email Security**

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Protecting our email system is critical to maintaining the integrity and security of Acme Corp's data and infrastructure. All users must:

*   **Password Strength:** Create strong, unique passwords of at least twelve characters, incorporating a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names).
*   **Password Management:** Utilize the company-approved password manager to securely store and manage credentials. Never write down passwords in an unsecured location.
*   **Password Rotation:** Change email passwords every 90 days or as prompted by IT security protocols.
*   **Phishing Awareness:** Be vigilant against phishing attempts. Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or suspicious senders, or when the content seems unusual or inadequately explained.
*   **Sender Verification:** Always verify the sender's email address and name to confirm legitimacy, especially for requests involving sensitive information or financial transactions.
*   **Red Flags:** Look for common red flags such as grammatical errors, excessive punctuation, unusual formatting, or inconsistencies in email content.
*   **Reporting Suspicious Activity:** Immediately report any suspicious emails, potential phishing attempts, or security concerns to the IT Security team.
*   **Antivirus/Anti-Malware:** Ensure that company-issued devices have up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware software installed and running.

**5. Email Signature**

A professional and consistent email signature enhances our corporate identity. Employees are encouraged to create a standard signature that includes:

*   [Employee Name]
*   [Employee Title], [Department]
*   Acme Corp (with company website link)
*   [Company Phone Number] | [Company Address]

Optional additions may include company logos, relevant certifications, or links to professional social media profiles, provided they are approved by the Marketing or HR department. Guidance on creating and implementing signatures can be obtained from the IT Helpdesk or your direct supervisor.

**MONITORING**

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all email communications and internet usage on its systems and networks, including content, volume, and recipients, to ensure compliance with this policy, protect company assets, and maintain a secure environment. Users should have no expectation of privacy when using company email for any purpose.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Violations of this Email Usage Policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, and potential legal action depending on the severity of the offense. Examples of violations that may lead to severe consequences include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information.
*   Sending or receiving emails containing illegal, harassing, or highly offensive content.
*   Using company email for fraudulent activities or to engage in unlawful conduct.
