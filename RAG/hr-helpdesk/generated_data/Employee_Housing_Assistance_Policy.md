## Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

The email usage policy at Acme Corp is designed to guide all employees in the appropriate and secure use of company-provided email accounts. As a leading Information Technology firm, email is a critical communication channel for our operations, client interactions, and internal collaboration. This policy aims to safeguard Acme Corp's proprietary information, maintain our professional reputation, and ensure compliance with data protection standards and legal obligations within India.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all individuals granted access to Acme Corp's email systems, including permanent employees, contractors, temporary staff, and any third-party personnel utilizing company email addresses or accessing company data via email. This encompasses individual and departmental email accounts, regardless of the device used for access.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Company email is a vital tool for business operations. While primarily intended for professional use, Acme Corp acknowledges the need for limited personal use, provided it adheres to the guidelines below.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email for all legitimate business purposes, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and internal teams.
*   Accessing and registering for business-critical software, platforms, and services.
*   Professional networking and representing Acme Corp at industry events.
*   Subscribing to industry newsletters, technical forums, and professional development resources relevant to their role.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using Acme Corp email, employees represent the company. Therefore, they must not:

*   Transmit or store confidential, sensitive, or proprietary company or client data without proper authorization and encryption.
*   Register for or engage with services that are competitive with Acme Corp's business offerings.
*   Send unsolicited commercial emails (spam) or chain letters, especially to colleagues or external contacts.
*   Access, distribute, or store illegal, offensive, discriminatory, or harassing content.
*   Sign up for unreliable, unverified, or potentially malicious websites or services.
*   Send excessively large attachments that may disrupt network performance without prior approval.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all corporate email communications for compliance with this policy and for security purposes.

**Personal Use**

Limited and reasonable personal use of corporate email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job duties, consume excessive company resources, or violate any other company policies. Examples include:

*   Registering for personal development courses or professional meetups.
*   Brief communications with family and friends, ensuring no confidential information is disclosed.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate educational materials or e-books for personal growth.

**Email Security**

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Employees are crucial in maintaining email security. They must:

*   Create and maintain strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoiding easily guessable personal information.
*   Avoid writing down passwords; instead, utilize secure password managers if necessary.
*   Change email passwords every 90 days or as prompted by IT security protocols.
*   Be vigilant against phishing attempts and suspicious emails by:
    *   Never opening attachments or clicking on links from unknown or unverified senders.
    *   Exercising caution with urgent or sensational subject lines (clickbait).
    *   Verifying sender addresses and names for legitimacy, looking for subtle misspellings or inconsistencies.
    *   Identifying stylistic red flags such as poor grammar, excessive punctuation, or unusual formatting.
*   Report any suspicious emails or potential security incidents immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Ensure their device's anti-malware and antivirus software is up-to-date.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to use a professional and consistent email signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand identity. This typically includes:

*   Employee's Full Name
*   Job Title
*   Acme Corp (with company website link)
*   Official Phone Number (if applicable)
*   Company Address

Images, company logos, and links to official company social media profiles may be included, following brand guidelines. Guidance on signature setup is available from the IT or Marketing departments.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Failure to adhere to this email usage policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Examples of violations that may lead to such consequences include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential company or client information.
*   Sending or receiving inappropriate, offensive, or harassing content.
*   Using corporate email for illegal activities.
*   Repeatedly falling victim to phishing scams due to negligence, leading to security breaches.
*   Deliberately circumventing security measures.

Each violation will be investigated thoroughly, and disciplinary actions will be determined based on the severity and frequency of the offense.
