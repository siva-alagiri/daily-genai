# Company Email Usage Policy

## POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE

The email usage policy at Acme Corp is designed to establish clear guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of company email accounts. As a leading Information Technology firm, email serves as a primary communication channel, and its responsible use is paramount to safeguarding our intellectual property, client data, and professional reputation. This policy aims to ensure that all digital communications align with our corporate values, legal obligations, and robust security standards.

## SCOPE

This policy applies to all individuals granted access to Acme Corp's email systems, including permanent employees, temporary staff, contractors, consultants, and any third parties utilizing our email infrastructure for business purposes. This encompasses all email accounts provided by Acme Corp, whether accessed on company-owned or personal devices, and regardless of the user's physical location.

## COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY

Company email is a vital tool for business operations. While we trust our employees to exercise good judgment, this policy clarifies expectations for its use.

### Correct Use of Corporate Email

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email accounts for all work-related activities, including but not limited to:

- Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and internal teams regarding projects, operations, and business development.
- Accessing and utilizing approved software, platforms, and services essential for job functions.
- Participating in professional networking, industry forums, and educational webinars that support professional growth and company objectives.
- Receiving official company communications, updates, and announcements.

### Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email

When using an Acme Corp email account, employees represent the company. Therefore, certain activities are strictly prohibited to protect our integrity and security:

- Sending, forwarding, or storing content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, defamatory, or illegal.
- Registering for or accessing unauthorized competitive services, platforms, or websites.
- Engaging in unsolicited mass emailing (spam) or chain letters.
- Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company or client information without explicit authorization.
- Attempting to bypass email security measures or access accounts without permission.
- Using email for personal financial gain, political lobbying, or extensive personal business.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all communications transmitted through its email systems to ensure compliance with this policy and to protect company assets.

### Personal Use

Acme Corp acknowledges that employees may occasionally need to use their corporate email for limited personal purposes. Acceptable personal use includes:

- Registering for professional development courses, industry events, or personal interest groups that do not conflict with company interests.
- Brief communications with family and friends, provided such communications are infrequent, do not disclose confidential information, and do not interfere with work duties or system performance.
- Subscribing to newsletters or downloading safe, appropriate content for personal growth, as long as it does not pose a security risk or consume excessive company resources.

### Email Security

Email is a frequent vector for cyber threats. All employees must adhere to stringent security practices to protect company data and systems:

- **Password Management:** Create strong, unique passwords (minimum 12 characters, combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) for all email accounts. Passwords must be changed every 90 days and should not be reused across different services. Avoid writing down passwords or sharing them.
- **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Be vigilant against suspicious emails. Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown senders or if the content seems unusual, even from known contacts. Always verify the sender's identity and look for red flags such as grammatical errors, urgent requests, or unusual formatting.
- **Reporting Suspicious Activity:** Immediately report any suspected phishing attempts, malware, or unauthorized access to the IT Security team.
- **Data Handling:** Exercise caution when sending sensitive information via email. Utilize encryption or secure file transfer protocols for highly confidential data as instructed by IT.
- **Device Security:** Ensure all devices used to access company email are protected with up-to-date antivirus software, firewalls, and operating system security patches.

### Email Signature

Employees are encouraged to maintain a professional and consistent email signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand identity. The standard signature format should include:

[Employee Name]
[Employee Title], [Department]
Acme Corp
[Company Website Link]
[Company Phone Number] | [Company Address]

Images, company logos, and links to approved professional social media profiles may be included, following brand guidelines. For assistance with signature setup, contact the IT Helpdesk.

## DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES

Violation of this Email Usage Policy will result in disciplinary action, which may include, but is not limited to, verbal warnings, written reprimands, suspension, demotion, or immediate termination of employment.
