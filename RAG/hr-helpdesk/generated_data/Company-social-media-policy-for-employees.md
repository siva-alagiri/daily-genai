## Acme Corp Email Usage Policy

### POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE

This Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp establishes the guidelines for the appropriate, secure, and professional use of company-provided email accounts and systems. As a leading Information Technology organization, email is a critical communication channel, and this policy aims to protect Acme Corp's sensitive data, intellectual property, and reputation, while fostering an efficient and respectful digital environment for all employees.

### SCOPE

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third-party personnel who are granted access to Acme Corp's email infrastructure, whether for individual or departmental use, across all our operational locations in India and globally.

### COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY

Acme Corp's email system is a vital tool for business operations. While we encourage its effective use, certain standards must be maintained.

#### Correct Use of Corporate Email

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email accounts for all work-related communications and activities, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and internal teams.
*   Accessing and utilizing approved software and online services essential for job functions.
*   Networking and professional engagement at industry events or conferences.
*   Subscribing to professional newsletters, industry updates, or platforms that support professional development.

#### Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email

When using corporate email, employees represent Acme Corp. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or defamatory towards any individual or group.
*   Registering for or accessing unauthorized competitive services or platforms without explicit management approval.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited commercial messages (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, or disreputable websites or services that could compromise company security or reputation.
*   Distributing unlawful marketing materials, chain letters, or unauthorized solicitations.
*   Engaging in any activity that violates local, national, or international laws.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all corporate email communications for compliance with this policy and for security purposes.

#### Personal Use

Acme Corp understands that employees may occasionally need to use their corporate email for limited personal purposes. Such use is permitted provided it does not interfere with job duties, compromise company resources, or violate any aspect of this policy. Examples include:

*   Registering for personal development courses or professional meetups.
*   Brief communications with friends and family, ensuring no confidential information is disclosed or spamming occurs.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate guides, e-books, or content for personal interest that does not consume excessive bandwidth or storage.

#### Email Security

Email remains a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Employees must adhere to the following security protocols to protect company assets and information:

*   **Password Strength:** Set strong, unique passwords of at least eight characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, avoiding personal information.
*   **Password Management:** Avoid writing down passwords. Utilize approved password managers if necessary.
*   **Regular Changes:** Change email passwords every four to six months.
*   **Phishing Awareness:** Exercise extreme caution with suspicious emails. Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or unverified senders.
*   **Verification:** Always verify the sender's identity and email address for legitimacy, especially for unexpected requests or urgent messages.
*   **Red Flags:** Be vigilant for grammatical errors, unusual phrasing, excessive capitalization, or inconsistencies that often indicate a phishing attempt.
*   **Reporting:** Immediately report any suspected phishing attempts or security concerns to the IT Security team.
*   **Antivirus Software:** Ensure that all company-issued devices have up-to-date anti-malware and antivirus software.

#### Email Signature

Employees are encouraged to maintain a professional and consistent email signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand identity. The standard format should include:

`[Employee Name]`
`[Employee Title], [Department]`
`Acme Corp | [Company Website Link]`
`[Phone Number] | [Company Address]`

Inclusion of company logos, work-related videos, or links is permissible if approved by the Marketing or Communications department. Guidance on signature setup can be obtained from the IT Helpdesk or your direct supervisor.

### DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES

Any employee found to be in violation of this Email Usage Policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include, but is not limited to, verbal warnings, written reprimands, suspension, or immediate termination of employment. Examples of severe violations leading to termination include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary company information.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using corporate email for any illegal activities.
