# Company Email Usage Policy

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

This policy outlines the guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of Acme Corp's electronic mail systems and services. Its primary purpose is to ensure that all digital communications are conducted professionally, maintain the confidentiality and integrity of company data, and comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements within the Information Technology sector in India. This policy supports a productive and secure digital environment for our 10,000 employees.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all personnel, including full-time employees, part-time employees, contractors, consultants, and any third-party vendors who are granted access to or use Acme Corp's email systems, whether on company-owned or personal devices, and regardless of their physical location.

**Components of the Policy**

Acme Corp's email system is a critical tool for business operations. While we provide a degree of flexibility, all users must adhere to the following principles:

**1. Professional Use**

Employees are authorized to use company email for activities directly related to their job responsibilities and Acme Corp's business objectives. This includes:
*   Facilitating official business communications with clients, partners, and internal teams.
*   Collaborating on projects and sharing work-related documents.
*   Accessing approved corporate applications and services that require email authentication.
*   Engaging in professional development activities, such as registering for industry webinars or training courses, where relevant to their role.

**2. Prohibited Use**

Users must not engage in any activities that could harm Acme Corp's reputation, compromise its security, or violate legal standards. Prohibited uses include, but are not limited to:
*   Sending or forwarding content that is offensive, discriminatory, harassing, defamatory, or sexually explicit.
*   Registering for competitive services or platforms without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Transmitting proprietary or confidential company information outside the organization without proper authorization and encryption.
*   Engaging in any illegal activities or promoting unlawful content.

**3. Limited Personal Use**

Acme Corp acknowledges that employees may occasionally need to use their company email for brief personal communications. Such use is permitted provided it:
*   Does not interfere with work duties or productivity.
*   Does not consume excessive company resources (e.g., storage, bandwidth).
*   Does not compromise company security or disclose any confidential information.
*   Includes activities like registering for personal educational courses or communicating briefly with family and friends.

**4. Email Security**

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats. All users are responsible for maintaining the security of their email accounts and exercising vigilance. Users must:
*   Employ robust, unique passwords that meet Acme Corp's password policy (minimum 12 characters, mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).
*   Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on their accounts where provided.
*   Exercise extreme caution when opening unsolicited emails, clicking on links, or downloading attachments from unknown or suspicious senders.
*   Verify the identity of senders for any unusual or unexpected messages, even if they appear to be from known contacts.
*   Report any suspected phishing attempts, malware, or security incidents immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Ensure all devices accessing company email have up-to-date security software and operating system patches.

**5. Email Signature**

To maintain a consistent and professional corporate image, all outgoing emails must include a standardized professional signature. This signature should typically include:
*   Employee's full name
*   Job title and department
*   Acme Corp's official name and website link
*   Official contact information (phone number, company address)
*   Company branding guidelines for logos or disclaimers must be strictly followed.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Any violation of this Email Usage Policy will be taken seriously and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Examples of severe violations include, but are not limited to:
*   Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential company information.
*   Sending or receiving inappropriate, offensive, or illegal content.
*   Using company email for fraudulent or unlawful activities.
*   Repeated disregard for email security protocols leading to system compromise.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor email usage to ensure compliance with this policy and to protect its assets and reputation.
