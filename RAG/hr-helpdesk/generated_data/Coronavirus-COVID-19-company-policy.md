## Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp establishes the guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of corporate email accounts. As a leading Information Technology firm, email is a fundamental communication channel, and its responsible use is critical to maintaining our professional reputation, protecting sensitive data, and ensuring operational efficiency. This policy aims to safeguard company information, prevent security breaches, and promote a consistent, professional communication standard across all levels of the organization.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and temporary staff of Acme Corp who are provided with or have access to a company email address, whether assigned individually or to a department. This includes use on company-owned devices and personal devices accessing company email.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Company email accounts are provided as essential tools for business operations. While a degree of personal use is permitted, all activities must align with Acme Corp's values and legal obligations.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are authorized to use their company email for all legitimate business purposes, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and colleagues regarding official business.
*   Accessing and utilizing company-approved software and platforms necessary for job functions.
*   Participating in professional networking, industry events, and educational initiatives that benefit Acme Corp or individual professional development.
*   Receiving official company communications, updates, and announcements.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When utilizing a corporate email address, employees represent Acme Corp. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending, forwarding, or storing content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, defamatory, or sexually explicit.
*   Registering for unauthorized competitive services, illegal websites, or disreputable online platforms.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited commercial emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company, client, or employee information without explicit authorization.
*   Engaging in any activity that violates local, national, or international laws, including intellectual property rights.
*   Using email for personal financial gain, political lobbying, or extensive non-work-related activities that could impact productivity or company resources.

**Personal Use**

Limited and reasonable personal use of company email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job duties, violate company policies, or compromise security. Examples of acceptable personal use include:

*   Registering for professional development courses or industry meetups.
*   Brief communications with friends and family, ensuring no confidential information is shared.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate educational materials or e-books for personal growth.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all corporate email communications in accordance with applicable laws and internal policies.

**Email Security**

Email remains a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Employees must exercise vigilance to protect company and personal data.

Employees are required to:

*   Create and maintain strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoiding easily guessable personal information.
*   Change email passwords every 90 days or as prompted by IT security protocols.
*   Report any suspected phishing attempts, suspicious emails, or security vulnerabilities immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Keep anti-malware and antivirus software on company-issued devices updated.

Employees should be cautious of:

*   Opening attachments or clicking on links from unknown or suspicious senders.
*   Emails with unusual grammar, spelling errors, or urgent, demanding tones.
*   Requests for personal or confidential information via email.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to use a professional email signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand identity. Sales, marketing, and executive personnel, in particular, should ensure their signatures are consistent and professional when interacting with external parties. A standard format should include:

`[Employee Name]`
`[Employee Title], [Department]`
`Acme Corp | [Company Website Link]`
`[Phone Number] | [Company Address]`

Company logos, approved social media links, or relevant certifications may also be included. Guidance on signature setup is available from the IT or Marketing department.
