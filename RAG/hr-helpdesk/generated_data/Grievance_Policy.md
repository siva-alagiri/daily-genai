**Company Cyber Security Policy**

**Policy Brief & Purpose**
Our Company Cyber Security Policy at Acme Corp outlines our comprehensive guidelines and robust provisions for safeguarding the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of our digital assets and technology infrastructure. As a leading Information Technology firm with 10,000 employees, we recognize that our reliance on advanced technology to develop, store, and manage critical information exposes us to evolving cyber threats. Human error, sophisticated attacks, and system vulnerabilities could lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and compromise client trust. For these reasons, we have implemented stringent security measures and established clear protocols to mitigate cyber risks, ensuring a secure and resilient operational environment.

**Scope**
This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, and any third parties who are granted permanent or temporary access to Acme Corp's systems, networks, data, and hardware, regardless of their location or the device used.

**Policy Elements**

**Confidential Data**
Confidential data at Acme Corp is defined as proprietary, sensitive, and valuable information critical to our business operations and client relationships. This includes, but is not limited to:
*   Proprietary software code, algorithms, and intellectual property.
*   Client data, including personal identifiable information (PII) and business-sensitive information.
*   Unpublished financial records, strategic plans, and market research.
*   Employee personal data and human resources records.
*   System configurations, network architecture, and security protocols.
All personnel are obligated to protect this data with the highest level of care and adhere to all data protection and privacy regulations, including those specific to India.

**Protect Personal and Company Devices**
When accessing Acme Corp's digital resources, all devices, whether company-issued or personal (under our BYOD policy), must adhere to strict security standards. Users are required to:
*   Ensure all devices are protected with strong, unique passwords or biometric authentication.
*   Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all corporate accounts and applications where available.
*   Install and maintain up-to-date endpoint protection software (antivirus/anti-malware) provided or approved by Acme Corp IT.
*   Apply security updates and patches for operating systems, applications, and browsers promptly as they become available.
*   Never leave devices unattended or unsecured in public or shared spaces.
*   Access company networks and sensitive data only through secure, encrypted connections (e.g., Acme Corp VPN).
*   Refrain from connecting company devices to untrusted public Wi-Fi networks without VPN protection.
New hires receiving company-issued equipment will receive mandatory training on device security setup, including disk encryption and password management tools.

**Keep Emails Safe**
Email remains a primary vector for cyberattacks. To prevent phishing, malware, and data breaches via email, employees must:
*   Exercise extreme caution with unsolicited emails, especially those containing attachments or links.
*   Be wary of emails with unusual sender addresses, generic greetings, grammatical errors, or urgent/threatening language.
*   Verify the legitimacy of senders, especially for requests involving sensitive information or financial transactions, by contacting them through an alternative, verified channel (e.g., phone call).
*   Report any suspicious emails or potential phishing attempts immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Never share login credentials or sensitive information in response to an email.

**Manage Passwords Properly**
Robust password practices are fundamental to our cybersecurity posture. Employees are required to:
*   Create strong, complex passwords of at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
*   Use unique passwords for each corporate account; never reuse passwords across different services.
*   Utilize Acme Corp's approved password manager to securely store and generate complex passwords.
*   Change passwords for critical systems every 90 days or as prompted by IT Security.
*   Never share passwords with anyone, including colleagues or IT support. If credentials must be exchanged for legitimate reasons, use secure, pre-approved methods.

**Transfer Data Securely**
Secure data transfer is paramount to protecting Acme Corp's and its clients' information. Employees must:
*   Avoid transferring sensitive data (e.g., client lists, proprietary code, financial reports) to personal devices, cloud storage, or unapproved external drives unless explicitly authorized and encrypted.
*   Use only Acme Corp's approved secure file transfer protocols and encrypted communication channels for sharing confidential information internally and externally.
*   Ensure that recipients of confidential data are authorized individuals or organizations with adequate security measures in place.
*   Never transmit sensitive data over public or unsecured networks without proper encryption and VPN protection.

**Report Scams, Privacy Breaches and Hacking Attempts**
Prompt reporting is crucial for effective incident response. All personnel must:
*   Immediately report any perceived cyberattacks, suspicious activities, privacy breaches, data loss, or potential security weaknesses in Acme Corp systems to the IT Security team.
*   Report any lost or stolen company devices (laptops, phones, tablets) without delay.
The IT Security team will investigate all reports promptly, take necessary corrective actions, and issue company-wide alerts when appropriate.

**Additional Measures**
To further enhance our security posture, all personnel are expected to:
*   Lock their computer screens and secure their devices when stepping away from their workstations.
*   Refrain from downloading or installing unauthorized, suspicious, or illegal software on company-issued equipment.
*   Avoid accessing suspicious or inappropriate websites that could pose a security risk.
*   Report any observed security policy violations by others.

**IT Security Team Responsibilities:**
Our dedicated IT Security team is responsible for:
*   Implementing and maintaining robust firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and access authentication mechanisms.
*   Conducting regular security awareness training for all employees.
*   Proactively monitoring for new threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors, and communicating relevant alerts to employees.
*   Leading incident response efforts for all security incidents.
*   Ensuring continuous compliance with this policy and evolving security standards.

**Remote Employees**
Remote employees are integral to Acme Corp's operations and must adhere strictly to all provisions of this policy. Special attention must be paid to:
*   Ensuring their home network is secured with a strong password and firewall.
*   Using Acme Corp's VPN for all access to company resources.
*   Maintaining physical security of company devices and documents in their remote workspace.
*   Seeking guidance from the IT Security team for any remote work security concerns.

**Disciplinary Action**
Acme Corp takes cybersecurity seriously. Any violation of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, and potential legal action, depending on the severity and intent of the breach.
*   **First-time, unintentional, small-scale security breach:** May result in a verbal warning, mandatory re-training on security protocols, and close monitoring.
*   **Intentional, repeated, or large-scale breaches (causing severe financial, reputational, or data damage):** Will lead to severe disciplinary action, including immediate termination of employment, and may involve legal prosecution in accordance with Indian laws.
Employees who consistently disregard security instructions, even if no breach occurs, will face progressive disciplinary measures.

**Take Security Seriously**
The trust of our clients, partners, and employees is built on our commitment to data security. Every individual at Acme Corp plays a critical role in protecting our digital ecosystem. By remaining vigilant and prioritizing cybersecurity, we collectively contribute to a safe, secure, and thriving environment for everyone.
