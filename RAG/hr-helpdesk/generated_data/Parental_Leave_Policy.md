## Work-From-Home Policy

**Effective Date:** [Current Date]

**1. Purpose:**
This Work-From-Home (WFH) Policy at Acme Corp outlines the framework and expectations for employees who are approved to perform their duties remotely. Our aim is to foster a flexible work environment that supports employee well-being, enhances productivity, and ensures business continuity, leveraging technology to empower our diverse workforce across India.

**2. Eligibility:**
Eligibility for remote work arrangements at Acme Corp is determined based on the nature of the role, job responsibilities, and individual performance history. Typically, roles that do not require constant physical presence, specialized on-site equipment, or direct client interaction (unless specifically approved) may be considered. All full-time employees who have successfully completed their probationary period are eligible to apply.

**3. Approval Process:**
Employees interested in a WFH arrangement must submit a formal request through the company's designated HR Information System (HRIS). Requests will undergo review by the immediate supervisor, considering team needs, project timelines, and impact on collaboration. Final approval rests with the department head and Human Resources, ensuring alignment with business objectives and policy guidelines.

**4. Equipment and Security:**
Acme Corp will provide essential equipment such as laptops and standard peripherals required for remote work. Employees are responsible for maintaining a stable internet connection and an ergonomic home workspace. Strict adherence to Acme Corp's cybersecurity policies, including the mandatory use of VPN, company-approved software, and data protection protocols, is paramount to safeguard sensitive company information.

**5. Work Hours:**
Remote employees are expected to adhere to their standard working hours as defined in their employment contracts. Any deviations or requirements for overtime must be pre-approved by their supervisor, in compliance with applicable Indian labor laws and company overtime policies.

**6. Communication:**
Maintaining consistent and effective communication is crucial for remote teams. Employees are required to utilize company-approved communication platforms (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack, internal portals) for all work-related interactions. Regular virtual team meetings, daily check-ins, and prompt responses to communications are expected.

**7. Productivity and Performance:**
Performance expectations for remote employees are consistent with those for in-office employees. Managers will establish clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and conduct regular performance reviews focusing on outcomes and contributions. Training will be provided to managers to effectively lead and support remote teams.

**8. Health and Safety:**
Employees are responsible for ensuring their remote workspace is safe, free from hazards, and conducive to productive work. Acme Corp will provide guidelines on ergonomic setup and general home office safety. Any work-related incidents or injuries occurring in the remote workspace must be reported immediately to the supervisor and HR.

**9. Expenses:**
Acme Corp will reimburse approved business-related expenses incurred during remote work, such as specific software licenses or office supplies, subject to prior approval and submission of valid receipts, in accordance with the company's expense policy. General utility or internet costs are typically the employee's responsibility unless explicitly covered by a separate policy or role-specific agreement.

**10. Termination of Remote Work Agreement:**
Acme Corp reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate any WFH arrangement at its sole discretion, based on business needs, changes in job responsibilities, or non-compliance with this policy. Employees will be provided with reasonable notice where feasible.

**11. Confidentiality:**
All remote employees must strictly adhere to Acme Corp's Confidentiality and Data Protection policies. Unauthorized disclosure or access to sensitive company, client, or employee information is strictly prohibited and will result in severe disciplinary action, including termination.
