## Acme Corp Cyber Security Policy

### Policy Brief & Purpose

This Acme Corp Cyber Security Policy outlines our comprehensive guidelines and provisions for safeguarding our digital assets, proprietary information, and technology infrastructure. As a leading Information Technology company, we recognize that robust cybersecurity is paramount to protecting our clients, employees, and business operations from evolving threats. This policy aims to establish a secure digital environment, mitigate risks, and ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of all company data and systems.

### Scope

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, vendors, and any third parties who have permanent or temporary access to Acme Corp's information systems, networks, devices, or data, regardless of their location or the device used.

### Policy Elements

#### Confidential Data

Confidential data at Acme Corp is defined as any information that is not publicly available and whose unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction could cause harm to the company, its clients, or its employees. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Client Data:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial records, project details, intellectual property.
*   **Proprietary Information:** Source code, algorithms, software designs, product roadmaps, research and development data.
*   **Financial Information:** Unpublished financial statements, budgets, investment strategies.
*   **Employee Data:** Personal information, payroll details, performance reviews.
*   **Business Strategies:** Marketing plans, sales forecasts, merger and acquisition details.

All individuals covered by this policy are obligated to protect this data with the highest level of care.

#### Protect Company and Personal Devices

When devices are used to access Acme Corp's resources, they become potential entry points for security breaches. All individuals are required to:

*   **Password Protect:** Ensure all devices (laptops, desktops, mobile phones, tablets) are secured with strong, unique passwords or biometric authentication.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA for all company accounts and services where available.
*   **Antivirus/Anti-Malware:** Install and maintain up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware software on all company-issued devices and personal devices used for work.
*   **Physical Security:** Never leave devices unattended in public spaces and ensure they are stored securely when not in use.
*   **Security Updates:** Install operating system, application, and browser security updates promptly as they become available.
*   **Secure Networks:** Access company accounts and systems only through secure, trusted networks. Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks unless using a company-approved VPN.
*   **Reporting:** Immediately report any lost, stolen, or compromised devices to the IT Security team.

#### Keep Emails Safe

Emails are a primary vector for cyberattacks. To prevent phishing, malware, and data breaches:

*   **Suspicious Emails:** Exercise extreme caution with emails from unknown senders or those with unexpected attachments or links.
*   **Verify Sender:** Always verify the sender's identity, especially for requests involving sensitive information or financial transactions. Look for inconsistencies in email addresses or unusual phrasing.
*   **Clickbait & Urgency:** Be wary of emails with sensational subject lines, urgent requests, or threats that pressure immediate action.
*   **Attachment & Link Scrutiny:** Do not open attachments or click on links in suspicious emails. If unsure, contact the IT Security team.
*   **Internal Reporting:** Report any suspected phishing attempts or malicious emails to the IT Security team immediately.

#### Manage Passwords Properly

Strong password practices are critical to account security:

*   **Complexity:** Create passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid easily guessable information (e.g., birthdays, common words).
*   **Uniqueness:** Use a unique password for each company account and service.
*   **Password Manager:** Utilize a company-approved password manager to securely store and generate complex passwords.
*   **Confidentiality:** Never share passwords with anyone, including colleagues or IT support.
*   **Regular Changes:** Change passwords for critical systems every 90 days or as prompted by system requirements.

#### Transfer Data Securely

Data transfer, especially of confidential information, must be handled with care:

*   **Approved Channels:** Use only company-approved secure channels and platforms for transferring sensitive data.
*   **Avoid Public Networks:** Do not transfer confidential data over unsecured public Wi-Fi networks.
*   **Recipient Authorization:** Ensure that the recipient of any data is authorized to receive it and has adequate security measures in place.
*   **Mass Transfers:** For mass transfers of sensitive data, consult with the IT Security team for guidance and assistance.

#### Report Scams, Privacy Breaches and Hacking Attempts

Prompt reporting is crucial for effective incident response:

*   **Immediate Notification:** Report any perceived cyberattacks, suspicious activities, privacy breaches, or hacking attempts to the IT Security team as soon as possible.
*   **Detailed Information:** Provide as much detail as possible about the incident, including screenshots, timestamps, and affected systems.
*   **No Self-Intervention:** Do not attempt to resolve security incidents independently unless explicitly instructed by the IT Security team.

#### Additional Measures

Acme Corp implements and expects adherence to the following:

*   **Access Control:** Implement least privilege access, ensuring individuals only have access to the data and systems necessary for their role.
*   **Firewalls & Intrusion Detection:** Maintain robust network firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems.
*   **Regular Backups:** Conduct frequent and secure backups of all critical data, stored both onsite and offsite.
*   **Security Training:** All employees will undergo mandatory cybersecurity awareness training annually, and specialized training for high-risk roles.
*   **Incident Response Plan:** Maintain and regularly test a comprehensive incident response plan to address security breaches effectively.
*   **Physical Security:** Ensure physical access to company premises and data centers is strictly controlled.
*   **Clean Desk Policy:** Maintain a clean desk policy to protect sensitive physical documents.

#### Remote Employees

Remote employees must adhere to all aspects of this policy. Additionally, they are responsible for:

*   **Secure Home Network:** Ensuring their home network is secured with a strong password and up-to-date router firmware.
*   **Dedicated Workspace:** Maintaining a private and secure workspace to prevent unauthorized viewing of sensitive information.
*   **VPN Usage:** Using the company-provided VPN for all access to internal systems and confidential data.
*   **Device Security:** Applying all device security measures (passwords, encryption, anti-malware) to personal devices used for work.

### Disciplinary Action

Acme Corp takes cybersecurity seriously. Any violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, and potential legal action.

*   **Minor Violations (Unintentional, Small-Scale):** May result in a verbal warning, mandatory retraining, and closer monitoring.
*   **Repeated or Negligent Violations:** May lead to written warnings, suspension, or demotion.
*   **Intentional or Large-Scale Breaches (Causing Severe Damage):** Will result in immediate termination of employment and may involve legal prosecution.

Each incident will be investigated thoroughly and handled on a case-by-case basis, considering the severity, intent, and impact of the violation.

### Take Security Seriously
