# Company Cyber Security Policy

**Policy Brief & Purpose**

This policy outlines Acme Corp's guidelines and provisions for preserving the security of our data and technology infrastructure. As a leading Information Technology company, we recognize that our reliance on technology to collect, store, and manage vast amounts of information makes us a prime target for cyber threats. Human errors, sophisticated hacker attacks, and system malfunctions could lead to significant financial damage, reputational harm, and compromise client trust. For these reasons, we have implemented robust security measures and prepared clear instructions to mitigate security risks. This policy ensures all personnel understand their critical role in maintaining our collective security posture.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all individuals associated with Acme Corp, including permanent employees, contractors, temporary staff, and any third-party personnel with access to our systems, networks, or data, globally.

**Policy Elements**

**Confidential Data**

Confidential data at Acme Corp encompasses all non-public information critical to our business operations, clients, and employees. This includes, but is not limited to: proprietary software code, intellectual property, client data, financial records, strategic plans, employee Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and sensitive project details. All personnel are obligated to protect this data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

**Protect Personal and Company Devices**

All devices used to access Acme Corp's resources, whether company-issued or personal (under an approved BYOD policy), must adhere to strict security standards. Personnel must:
*   Ensure all devices are password-protected with strong, unique credentials.
*   Enable full disk encryption on laptops and mobile devices.
*   Install and maintain approved anti-malware and endpoint detection software provided by Acme Corp IT.
*   Apply security updates and patches for operating systems and applications promptly.
*   Never leave devices unattended or unsecured in public or unsecured areas.
*   Access company networks and data only through secure, approved connections (e.g., corporate VPN).
*   Report lost or stolen devices immediately to the IT Security team.

**Keep Emails Safe**

Email remains a primary vector for cyber threats. To mitigate risks, all personnel must:
*   Exercise extreme caution with unsolicited emails, especially those containing attachments or links.
*   Verify the sender's legitimacy before interacting with suspicious emails, even if they appear to be from internal sources.
*   Be wary of phishing attempts, social engineering tactics, and unusual requests for sensitive information.
*   Report any suspicious emails or potential security incidents to the IT Security team immediately.
*   Avoid sharing sensitive company or client information via unencrypted email.

**Manage Passwords Properly**

Robust password practices are fundamental to our security. Personnel must:
*   Create strong, unique passwords for all Acme Corp accounts, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, with a minimum length of 12 characters.
*   Utilize Acme Corp's approved password manager to store and generate complex passwords.
*   Never share passwords with anyone, including colleagues or IT support.
*   Change passwords immediately if a compromise is suspected.
*   Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever required or available.

**Transfer Data Securely**

Data transfer must always prioritize security and confidentiality. Personnel must:
*   Use only approved, encrypted methods for transferring sensitive or confidential data (e.g., secure file transfer protocols, encrypted cloud storage solutions).
*   Avoid transferring confidential data to personal devices or unauthorized external storage.
*   Ensure that recipients of data are authorized and have appropriate security measures in place.
*   Never use public Wi-Fi or unsecured networks for transferring sensitive company information without an active VPN connection.

**Report Scams, Privacy Breaches and Hacking Attempts**

Prompt reporting is crucial for effective incident response. All personnel must report any suspected cyber incidents, security vulnerabilities, or privacy breaches to the IT Security team without delay. This includes, but is not limited to, unusual system behavior, unauthorized access attempts, data loss, or suspicious communications.

**Additional Measures**

Acme Corp implements and expects adherence to the following:
*   **Access Control**: Strict role-based access controls are enforced for all systems and data, reviewed periodically.
*   **Security Training**: Mandatory annual cybersecurity awareness training for all personnel, with specialized training for high-risk roles.
*   **Physical Security**: Adherence to physical security protocols for company premises, data centers, and equipment.
*   **Clean Desk Policy**: Maintain a clean desk to protect physical documents and removable media.
*   **Software Usage**: Only authorized and licensed software may be installed and used on company devices.
*   **Secure Development Practices**: Development teams must follow secure coding guidelines and conduct regular security testing.
*   **Incident Response Plan**: A dedicated IT Security team manages and responds to all reported incidents.

**Remote Employees**

Remote employees are integral to Acme Corp and must uphold the same cybersecurity standards as in-office personnel. This includes:
*   Ensuring home networks are secured with strong passwords and up-to-date firmware.
*   Using company-provided VPN for all access to internal resources.
*   Maintaining a dedicated, secure workspace free from unauthorized access.
*   Adhering to all data protection and device security policies.

**Disciplinary Action**

Non-compliance with this policy will be treated with utmost seriousness. Violations may lead to disciplinary action, ranging from formal warnings and mandatory retraining to suspension or immediate termination of employment, depending on the severity, intent, and impact of the breach. Legal action may also be pursued where applicable.

**Take Security Seriously**

Cybersecurity is a collective responsibility at Acme Corp. Every individual plays a vital role in protecting our digital ecosystem, client trust, and business continuity. By remaining vigilant and adhering to these guidelines, we collectively strengthen our defenses against evolving cyber threats.
