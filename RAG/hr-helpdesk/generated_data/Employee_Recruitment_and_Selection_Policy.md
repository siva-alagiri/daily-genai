# Company Email Usage Policy

**Policy Brief and Purpose**

The Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp is designed to guide employees on the appropriate and secure use of their corporate email accounts. As email is a primary communication channel and a repository of critical information, this policy aims to safeguard company data, maintain our professional reputation, and ensure compliance with internal standards and external regulations.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties granted access to Acme Corp's email systems, whether individually assigned or departmentally managed.

**Components of the Policy**

Acme Corp's email system is a vital tool for business operations. While primarily intended for work-related communications, we acknowledge the need for limited personal use, provided it adheres to the guidelines below.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email for all legitimate business purposes, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, and colleagues.
*   Accessing company-approved software and platforms necessary for job functions.
*   Professional networking and industry event registrations.
*   Receiving work-related updates and information.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When utilizing their corporate email, employees act as representatives of Acme Corp. Therefore, they must refrain from:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or illegal.
*   Registering for services or platforms that are competitive with Acme Corp's business without explicit authorization.
*   Engaging in unsolicited mass emailing (spam) or chain letters.
*   Subscribing to or interacting with unreliable, illicit, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information without proper authorization.
*   Participating in political campaigning or lobbying activities on behalf of the company without official approval.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of corporate email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job duties, consume excessive company resources, or violate any other company policies. Examples of acceptable personal use include:

*   Registering for professional development courses or industry meetups.
*   Brief communications with family and friends, ensuring no confidential information is shared.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate educational materials or e-books for personal growth.

**Email Security**

Email remains a significant vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Protecting our email infrastructure is paramount to maintaining data integrity and company reputation. Employees must:

*   Create and maintain strong, unique passwords (minimum 12 characters, combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) for their email accounts, avoiding personal information.
*   Change passwords every 90 days.
*   Never share their email passwords with anyone.
*   Be vigilant against phishing attempts:
    *   Do not open suspicious attachments or click on unverified links.
    *   Exercise caution with emails offering unusual benefits or demanding urgent action.
    *   Verify sender identity, especially for unexpected requests from known contacts.
    *   Report any suspicious emails immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Ensure their anti-malware and antivirus software on company-issued devices is up-to-date.
*   Contact the IT Security team if unsure about the legitimacy of an email or any security concern.

**Email Signature**

A consistent and professional email signature reinforces our brand identity. Employees are encouraged to use the standard company email signature template provided by the Marketing or IT department. This typically includes:

*   Employee's Full Name
*   Job Title
*   Acme Corp (with company website link)
*   Company Phone Number (optional)
*   Company Address
*   Company Logo (optional, as per branding guidelines)

Avoid adding personal quotes, excessive images, or non-work-related links.

**Disciplinary Consequences**

Violations of this Email Usage Policy will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Examples of severe violations include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential company information.
*   Sending or receiving illegal or highly offensive content.
*   Using corporate email for fraudulent activities.
*   Repeated disregard for security protocols, leading to system vulnerabilities.
