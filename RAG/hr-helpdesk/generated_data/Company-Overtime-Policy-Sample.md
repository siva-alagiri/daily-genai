# Company Cyber Security Policy

**Policy brief & purpose**

Our Company Cyber Security Policy at Acme Corp outlines our comprehensive guidelines and provisions for safeguarding our digital assets, proprietary information, and technology infrastructure. As a leading Information Technology firm, we recognize that robust cybersecurity is paramount to maintaining client trust, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring operational continuity. This policy is designed to mitigate risks from cyber threats, human error, and system vulnerabilities, thereby protecting our reputation, financial stability, and the privacy of all stakeholders.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, interns, and any third parties who have permanent or temporary access to our systems, networks, devices, or data, regardless of their location or the device used (company-issued or personal for work purposes).

**Policy elements**

**Confidential data**

Confidential data at Acme Corp is defined as any information that is not publicly available and whose unauthorized disclosure could cause harm to the company, its clients, or employees. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Client data, project specifications, and contractual agreements.
*   Proprietary software code, algorithms, and development plans.
*   Unpublished financial records, business strategies, and market research.
*   Employee personal information and HR records.
*   Network configurations, system architecture, and security protocols.

All personnel are obligated to protect this data with the highest level of care.

**Protect personal and company devices**

Devices used to access Acme Corp's resources, whether company-issued or personal, pose potential security risks. All users must ensure these devices are secure by:

*   Implementing strong, unique password or biometric protection for all devices.
*   Ensuring up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware software is installed and actively scanning.
*   Never leaving devices unattended or unsecured in public or shared spaces.
*   Installing security updates for operating systems, applications, and browsers promptly.
*   Accessing company accounts and systems only through secure, trusted networks. Public Wi-Fi should be avoided for sensitive tasks or used with an approved Virtual Private Network (VPN).
*   Immediately reporting any lost, stolen, or compromised devices to the IT Security team.

New hires receiving company-issued equipment will be provided with instructions for disk encryption, password management tool setup, and mandatory security software installation.

**Keep emails safe**

Emails are a primary vector for cyberattacks. To prevent phishing, malware, and data breaches via email, all users must:

*   Exercise extreme caution with unsolicited emails, especially those containing attachments or links. Do not open them if the content is vague or suspicious.
*   Be wary of emails with urgent or threatening language, unusual sender addresses, or requests for sensitive information.
*   Verify the sender's identity, especially for internal emails requesting unusual actions or information, by checking the full email address and, if necessary, contacting the sender through an alternative, verified channel.
*   Report any suspicious emails to the IT Security team immediately, rather than deleting them.

**Manage passwords properly**

Strong password practices are critical to account security. All users must:

*   Create complex passwords of at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
*   Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names) or easily guessable patterns.
*   Utilize Acme Corp's approved password manager to generate and store unique passwords for different services.
*   Never share passwords with anyone, including colleagues or IT support.
*   Change passwords for critical systems every 90 days.
*   Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever available and required by Acme Corp.

**Transfer data securely**

Secure data transfer is essential to prevent unauthorized access. Users must:

*   Avoid transferring sensitive or confidential data to personal devices or unauthorized cloud storage services.
*   Use only approved, encrypted company channels (e.g., secure file transfer protocols, internal collaboration platforms) for sharing confidential information.
*   Never share confidential data over public or unsecured networks.
*   Ensure that recipients of data are authorized and understand their responsibility to protect the information, especially when collaborating with external partners.

**Report scams, privacy breaches and hacking attempts**

Prompt reporting is crucial for effective incident response. All users must report any perceived cyberattacks, suspicious activities, privacy breaches, or security vulnerabilities to the IT Security team immediately. The IT Security team will investigate all reports thoroughly, implement necessary countermeasures, and issue company-wide alerts when appropriate.

**Additional measures**

To further enhance our cybersecurity posture, all personnel are expected to:

*   Lock their computer screens or devices when stepping away from their workstations.
*   Report any stolen or damaged company equipment to HR and IT Security without delay.
*   Refrain from downloading or installing unauthorized, suspicious, or illegal software on company devices.
*   Avoid accessing websites known to host malicious content or engage in illegal activities.
*   Participate in mandatory cybersecurity awareness training sessions provided by Acme Corp.

**Remote employees**

Remote employees are integral to Acme Corp's operations and must adhere to all aspects of this policy. They are specifically required to:

*   Ensure their home network is secured with a strong password and firewall.
*   Use company-provided VPN for all access to internal systems and data.
*   Maintain a dedicated and secure workspace to prevent unauthorized access to company information.
*   Seek guidance from the IT Security team for any concerns regarding their remote setup.

**Disciplinary Action**

Acme Corp takes cybersecurity seriously. Violations of this policy will result in disciplinary action, which may include:

*   **Minor, unintentional breaches:** Verbal warning and mandatory re-training on cybersecurity best practices.
*   **Repeated or negligent breaches:** Written warning, suspension, or demotion.
*   **Intentional, malicious, or large-scale breaches (causing significant financial or reputational damage):** Immediate termination of employment and potential legal action, in accordance with applicable laws and employment contracts.

Each incident will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering intent, impact, and prior history.

**Take security seriously**

Cybersecurity is a collective responsibility. Every individual at Acme Corp plays a vital role in protecting our digital environment. By remaining vigilant, adhering to these guidelines, and actively participating in our security efforts, we can collectively safeguard Acme Corp's assets, maintain client trust, and uphold our reputation as a secure and reliable IT partner.
