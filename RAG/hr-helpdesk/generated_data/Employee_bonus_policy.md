*   Verify the legitimacy of senders by checking email addresses for inconsistencies or unusual domains.
*   Report any suspicious emails, phishing attempts, or security concerns immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Ensure all devices used to access company email have up-to-date anti-malware and security software.
