# Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This policy outlines the guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of corporate email accounts by employees of Acme Corp. As a leading Information Technology company, email is a fundamental communication tool, and its responsible use is critical to protecting our intellectual property, maintaining our professional reputation, and ensuring compliance with data protection standards in India and globally. This policy aims to prevent data breaches, uphold ethical communication, and safeguard our technological infrastructure.

Acme Corp's email system is provided primarily for business-related communications and activities. While limited personal use is permitted, all users must adhere to the principles of professionalism, security, and compliance.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email for:

*   **Business Communication:** Engaging in correspondence with clients, partners, vendors, and colleagues for official company business.
*   **Collaboration:** Facilitating project discussions, sharing work-related documents, and coordinating tasks within teams and across departments.
*   **Resource Access:** Logging into approved software, platforms, and services necessary for performing job functions.
*   **Professional Networking:** Representing Acme Corp in professional forums, industry events, and approved online communities.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using Acme Corp email, employees must not:

*   **Unauthorized Disclosure:** Share confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company, client, or employee information with unauthorized individuals or entities.

**Personal Use**

Acme Corp acknowledges that employees may occasionally need to use their corporate email for personal matters. Such use must be:

*   **Limited and Non-Disruptive:** Personal use should be minimal, not interfere with work duties, and not consume excessive company resources (e.g., bandwidth, storage).
*   **Professional Development:** Subscribing to industry newsletters, professional organizations, or educational platforms relevant to personal growth, provided they are safe and appropriate.
*   **Family and Friends:** Sending occasional emails to friends and family, ensuring no confidential information is disclosed and it does not constitute spam.

**Email Security**

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats. Employees are responsible for maintaining the security of their email accounts and exercising vigilance:

*   **Strong Passwords:** Set and regularly update complex passwords that combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, avoiding easily guessable personal information.
*   **Phishing Awareness:** Be highly suspicious of unsolicited emails, unexpected attachments, or suspicious links. Verify the sender's legitimacy before clicking or downloading.
*   **Malware Prevention:** Do not download or install unapproved software or applications. Keep anti-malware programs updated on company-issued devices.
*   **Reporting Incidents:** Immediately report any suspected phishing attempts, unauthorized account access, or security breaches to the IT Security team.
*   **Confidentiality:** Avoid writing down passwords or sharing them with anyone.

**Email Signature**

To maintain a consistent and professional corporate image, employees are required to use a standardized email signature for all outgoing business communications. This signature should include:

*   Employee's Full Name
