## Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp establishes the guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of corporate email accounts by all personnel. As a leading Information Technology firm, our email system is a critical communication and collaboration tool, vital for our operations and client interactions. This policy aims to safeguard Acme Corp's confidential information, maintain our professional reputation, and ensure the integrity and efficiency of our technological infrastructure.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties granted access to or assigned an Acme Corp email address, whether individual or departmental. This includes email access from company-issued devices, personal devices, or any network, public or private.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp’s email system is provided primarily for business-related communications. While a degree of personal use is permitted, all users are expected to prioritize business needs and adhere to the principles outlined below.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Users are authorized to utilize their Acme Corp email for activities directly supporting their job functions and the company's objectives, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and internal teams.
*   Accessing and registering for business-critical software, platforms, and services.
*   Professional networking and information exchange at industry events.
*   Subscribing to professional newsletters, journals, or educational resources relevant to their role or professional development.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using an Acme Corp email, users represent the company. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or defamatory towards any individual or group.
*   Registering for services or platforms that are competitive with Acme Corp's business without explicit authorization from senior management.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Accessing, subscribing to, or engaging with illegal, unreliable, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Distributing unlawful marketing materials, chain letters, or unauthorized solicitations.
*   Sharing confidential company, client, or proprietary information with unauthorized individuals or entities.
*   Engaging in any activity that violates local, national, or international laws.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of corporate email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with work duties, compromise company resources, or violate any other policy. Acceptable personal use includes:

*   Brief communications with friends and family, ensuring no confidential information is disclosed.
*   Registering for personal educational courses, workshops, or meetups that are safe and appropriate.
*   Downloading non-work-related guides, e-books, or content that is safe, appropriate, and does not consume excessive bandwidth or storage.

**Email Security**

Email remains a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. All users must exercise vigilance to protect company and personal data.

*   **Password Management:**
    *   Set strong, unique passwords of at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names).
    *   Never write down or share passwords.
    *   Change email passwords every 90 days.
*   **Threat Awareness:**
    *   Be cautious of emails with suspicious attachments or links, especially if the content is vague or unexpected.
    *   Identify common phishing indicators: unusual sender addresses, grammatical errors, excessive exclamation marks, urgent or threatening language, or requests for personal information.
    *   Always verify the sender's legitimacy before interacting with suspicious emails.
    *   Report any suspected phishing attempts or unusual email activity to the IT Security team immediately.
*   **Software Updates:**
    *   Ensure all anti-malware and security software on devices used to access company email is regularly updated.

**Email Signature**

A consistent and professional email signature enhances Acme Corp's brand image. All official communications should include a standard signature.

*   **Standard Format:**
    *   [Your Full Name]
    *   [Your Job Title], [Your Department]
    *   Acme Corp
    *   [Your Phone Number (optional)] | [Company Website Link]
*   Users may include company logos or approved work-related links. Guidance on signature creation is available from the Marketing or IT department.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Any violation of this Email Usage Policy will result in disciplinary action, which may range from a formal warning to immediate termination of employment, depending on the severity and frequency of the offense. Examples of violations that may lead to severe consequences include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential company or client information via email.
