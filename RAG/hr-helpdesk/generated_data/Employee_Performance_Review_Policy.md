## Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp outlines the expectations and guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of corporate email accounts by all personnel. As a leading Information Technology firm, email is a critical communication channel and a repository of valuable data. This policy aims to ensure professional conduct, safeguard sensitive information, maintain the integrity of our digital infrastructure, and uphold Acme Corp’s reputation in the market.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third-party personnel who are assigned or granted access to an Acme Corp email address, whether individually or as part of a departmental account. This includes access from company-issued devices, personal devices, or any network.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp email is a vital tool for business operations and collaboration. While primarily intended for work-related communications, we acknowledge the need for reasonable personal use within defined boundaries.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Acme Corp employees are authorized to use their company email for all legitimate business purposes, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and internal teams regarding official business.
*   Accessing and utilizing company-approved software, platforms, and services essential for job functions.
*   Participating in professional development, industry forums, and networking events that benefit Acme Corp.
*   Receiving official company announcements, updates, and internal communications.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using an Acme Corp email account, individuals represent the company. Therefore, the following uses are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending, forwarding, or storing content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, defamatory, or illegal.
*   Registering for or subscribing to services, websites, or platforms that are unreliable, illegal, or disreputable, especially those that could compromise company security or reputation.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company, client, or partner information without explicit authorization.
*   Engaging in activities that promote personal businesses, political agendas, or non-work-related solicitations.
*   Attempting to bypass security measures or access unauthorized systems.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all corporate email communications for compliance with this policy and for security purposes.

**Personal Use**

Employees may use their corporate email for limited and reasonable personal activities, provided such use does not:

*   Interfere with job duties or productivity.
*   Disclose any confidential company information.
*   Violate any other company policies or legal regulations.
*   Involve excessive bandwidth consumption or storage.
*   Examples include registering for professional courses, receiving personal notifications, or communicating briefly with family/friends.

**Email Security**

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Protecting our email system is paramount to maintaining our operational security and data integrity. Employees must:

*   Create and maintain strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, adhering to Acme Corp's password policy (minimum 12 characters, combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols, no personal information).
*   Change email passwords every 90 days or as prompted by IT security protocols.
*   Never share email passwords with anyone, including IT support.
*   Be vigilant against phishing attempts:
    *   Do not open suspicious attachments or click on links from unknown senders or if the content seems unusual.
    *   Verify the sender's email address for legitimacy, looking for subtle misspellings or domain discrepancies.
    *   Report any suspicious emails immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Ensure all company-issued devices used for email access have up-to-date anti-malware and security software installed and active.
*   Encrypt sensitive data when transmitting it via email, using company-approved methods.

**Email Signature**

Employees are encouraged to use a professional email signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand identity and provides essential contact information. The standard format should include:

`[Employee Name]`
`[Employee Title], [Department]`
`Acme Corp`
`[Company Website Link]`
`[Phone Number (Optional)] | [Company Address (Optional)]`

Images, company logos, and links to official company social media profiles are permitted if they adhere to brand guidelines. For assistance with signature setup, contact the IT Helpdesk or your direct supervisor.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Any violation of this Email Usage Policy will be taken seriously and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, and potential legal action depending on the severity and nature of the breach. Examples of violations that may lead to severe consequences include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential company, client, or partner data.
