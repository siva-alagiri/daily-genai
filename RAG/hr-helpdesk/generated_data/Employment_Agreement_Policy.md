This includes all email communications sent from or received on company-provided devices or personal devices accessing company email.

### Policy Elements

Acme Corp's email system is a powerful tool designed to facilitate business communication and enhance productivity. While we offer a degree of flexibility, all usage must align with our professional standards and security protocols.

#### Email Security

Given the nature of our business, email security is paramount. Employees must exercise vigilance to protect company data and systems from cyber threats.

*   **Strong Passwords:** Set and regularly update strong, unique passwords for all email accounts, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be enabled where available.
