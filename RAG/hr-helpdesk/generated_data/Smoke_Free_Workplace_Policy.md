## Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

At Acme Corp, email is a fundamental communication channel for our global operations and client interactions. This policy outlines the expectations for the appropriate and secure use of company email accounts by all personnel. Its purpose is to ensure the integrity of our digital communications, safeguard sensitive information, maintain our professional reputation, and comply with data protection standards relevant to our Information Technology sector in India.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties granted access to or assigned an Acme Corp email address, whether for individual or departmental use. This includes all email accounts hosted on Acme Corp's servers or used to conduct company business, regardless of the device or network used for access.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Company email is a vital tool for facilitating business operations. While primarily intended for professional use, we acknowledge that limited personal use may occur. This policy defines both acceptable and unacceptable practices.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Acme Corp employees are encouraged to utilize their company email for all work-related communications without undue restriction, provided it aligns with company objectives. Examples include:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, and vendors.
*   Accessing and registering for business-critical software and services.
*   Professional networking and engagement at industry events.
*   Subscribing to professional newsletters, industry updates, or online platforms that support job functions or professional development.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using an Acme Corp email address, individuals represent the company. Therefore, certain activities are strictly prohibited to protect our brand, security, and legal standing:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or defamatory.
*   Registering for or accessing competitive services or platforms without explicit authorization.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, suspicious, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Distributing unlawful marketing materials, chain letters, or unauthorized solicitations.
*   Sharing confidential company, client, or employee information with unauthorized parties.
*   Engaging in any activity that violates local Indian laws or international regulations.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor corporate email communications for compliance with this policy and for security purposes.

**Personal Use**

Employees may use their corporate email for limited personal activities, provided such use is reasonable, does not interfere with job duties, and does not compromise company resources or security. Examples include:

*   Registering for educational courses or professional meetups.
*   Sending brief, non-sensitive emails to friends and family.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate guides, e-books, or content for personal interest.

**Email Security**

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Protecting our email system is paramount to safeguarding Acme Corp's data and reputation. All users must:

*   Create and maintain strong, unique passwords (minimum eight characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) that do not contain personal information.
*   Avoid writing down passwords; utilize secure password managers if necessary.
*   Change email passwords every 90 days.
*   Be vigilant against phishing attempts and suspicious emails:
    *   Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or suspicious senders.
    *   Be wary of urgent or enticing subject lines (clickbait).
    *   Verify sender names and email addresses for legitimacy, looking for subtle inconsistencies.
    *   Identify style red flags such as grammatical errors, excessive punctuation, or unusual formatting.
*   Report any suspicious emails or perceived security threats immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Ensure anti-malware and antivirus software on company-issued devices is up-to-date.

**Email Signature**

Professional email signatures enhance our corporate image. All employees are encouraged to use a standardized signature format that includes:

*   [Employee Name]
*   [Employee Title], Acme Corp
*   [Company Website Link]
*   [Phone Number]
*   [Company Address]

Optional additions like company logos or work-related social media links may be included, subject to departmental guidelines. Assistance with signature setup is available from the IT Department or direct supervisors.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Failure to adhere to this Email Usage Policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, depending on the severity and frequency of the violation. Examples of actions that may lead to severe consequences include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential company or client information.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to colleagues, clients, or partners.
*   Using corporate email for illegal activities or to facilitate fraud.
*   Repeated disregard for email security protocols leading to system vulnerabilities.
