## Acme Corp Cyber Security Policy

### Policy Brief & Purpose

This Cyber Security Policy at Acme Corp outlines our comprehensive framework and established protocols for safeguarding our digital assets, information infrastructure, and proprietary data. As a leading Information Technology company with 10,000 employees, we recognize that robust cybersecurity is paramount to maintaining operational integrity, protecting client trust, and preserving our competitive edge. This policy is designed to mitigate risks from cyber threats, human error, and system vulnerabilities, ensuring a secure and resilient environment for all our operations.

### Scope

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, interns, and any third-party personnel who have temporary or permanent access to our systems, networks, devices, or data, regardless of their location or the device used.

### Policy Elements

#### Confidential Data

Confidential data at Acme Corp is defined as any information that is not publicly available and holds significant value to the company, its clients, or partners. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Proprietary software, algorithms, and intellectual property
*   Client data, personal identifiable information (PII), and sensitive project details
*   Unpublished financial records, business strategies, and market research
*   Employee records and human resources information
*   System architectures, network configurations, and security protocols

All personnel are obligated to protect this data diligently.

#### Protect Company and Personal Devices

When accessing Acme Corp resources, all devices, whether company-issued or personal (under our BYOD policy), must adhere to strict security standards. Employees are required to:

*   Ensure all devices are protected with strong, unique passwords or biometric authentication.
*   Install and regularly update approved antivirus and anti-malware software provided or mandated by Acme Corp IT.
*   Never leave devices unattended or unsecured in public or shared spaces.
*   Apply security updates for operating systems and applications promptly as released.
*   Access company networks and accounts exclusively through secure, encrypted connections (e.g., Acme Corp VPN).
*   Report any lost or stolen devices immediately to the IT Security team.

New hires receiving company-issued equipment will be provided with detailed instructions for disk encryption, password management tool setup, and mandatory security software installation.

#### Keep Emails Safe

Email remains a primary vector for cyberattacks. To prevent malware infections, phishing attempts, and data breaches, employees must:

*   Exercise extreme caution with unsolicited emails, especially those containing attachments or links. Do not open or click if the sender is unknown or the content seems suspicious.
*   Be wary of emails with urgent or enticing subject lines (e.g., prize notifications, unexpected invoices).
*   Verify the sender's email address and name for legitimacy, looking for subtle inconsistencies.
*   Report any suspicious emails to the IT Security team immediately using the designated reporting mechanism.
*   Never disclose login credentials or sensitive information via email.

#### Manage Passwords Properly

Strong password hygiene is critical for protecting access to Acme Corp systems. Employees are required to:

*   Create complex passwords of at least 12 characters, incorporating a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
*   Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdays, names, or common words.
*   Utilize Acme Corp's approved password manager to generate and securely store unique passwords for different accounts.
*   Never share passwords with anyone, including colleagues or IT support.
*   Change passwords every 90 days or immediately if a compromise is suspected.

#### Transfer Data Securely

Secure data transfer protocols must be followed to prevent unauthorized access or interception. Employees must:

*   Avoid transferring sensitive or confidential data to unapproved personal devices or cloud storage services.
*   Utilize only Acme Corp's secure internal networks and approved encrypted channels for sharing confidential information.
*   Verify that the recipients of any data transfer are authorized individuals or entities with appropriate security measures in place.
*   Consult the IT Security team for guidance on transferring large volumes of sensitive data.

#### Report Scams, Privacy Breaches and Hacking Attempts

Prompt reporting of security incidents is crucial for rapid response and mitigation. Employees must:

*   Report any perceived cyberattacks, suspicious activities, phishing attempts, or privacy breaches to the IT Security team immediately.
*   Provide all available details regarding the incident to assist with investigation.
*   The IT Security team will investigate all reports promptly, resolve issues, and issue company-wide alerts when necessary.

#### Additional Measures

To further enhance our cybersecurity posture, all personnel are expected to:

*   Lock their computer screens and devices when stepping away from their workstations.
*   Report any stolen or damaged company equipment to the IT department and HR immediately.
*   Refrain from downloading or installing unauthorized, suspicious, or illegal software on company-issued devices.
*   Avoid accessing websites known to host malicious content or engage in illicit activities.

#### Remote Employees

Remote employees are integral to Acme Corp and must adhere to all aspects of this policy. They are specifically responsible for:

*   Ensuring their home network is secured with a strong password and firewall.
*   Using Acme Corp's VPN for all access to internal systems and data.
*   Maintaining a secure and private workspace to prevent unauthorized viewing of sensitive information.
*   Seeking guidance from the IT Security team for any concerns regarding remote work security.

### Disciplinary Action

Acme Corp takes cybersecurity seriously. Any violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, ranging from formal warnings to immediate termination of employment, and potentially legal action, depending on the severity and intent of the breach.

*   **Minor, unintentional breaches:** May result in verbal warnings and mandatory retraining on security protocols.
*   **Repeated or negligent breaches:** May lead to written warnings, suspension, or demotion.
*   **Intentional, large-scale breaches or those causing significant financial/reputational damage:** Will result in immediate termination and potential legal prosecution.

Each incident will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by HR and the IT Security team.

### Take Security Seriously

Cybersecurity is a collective responsibility. Every individual at Acme Corp, from new hires to senior leadership, plays a vital role in protecting our digital assets. By remaining vigilant, adhering to these guidelines, and actively reporting concerns, we collectively strengthen our defenses and uphold the trust placed in us by our clients and partners. We encourage everyone to stay informed about evolving cyber threats and contribute to a culture of security awareness.
