# Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp establishes clear guidelines for the appropriate, responsible, and secure use of corporate email accounts and systems. As a leading Information Technology company, email is a critical communication and data exchange tool. This policy aims to safeguard sensitive company and client information, uphold professional communication standards, ensure compliance with data protection regulations, and protect our technological infrastructure from threats.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all permanent, temporary, and contract employees, as well as third-party vendors, consultants, and any other individuals who are provided with or use Acme Corp's email systems and infrastructure for business purposes, regardless of their location or device used.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp's email system is a powerful asset designed to facilitate business operations. While we trust our employees to exercise good judgment, this policy defines the boundaries for its use.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email accounts for all legitimate business communications and activities that support the company's objectives. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, and external stakeholders.
*   Internal collaboration on projects, departmental discussions, and official announcements.
*   Accessing and registering for approved software, online services, and professional development platforms relevant to job functions.
*   Exchanging contact information at industry conferences, workshops, and business networking events.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

Employees must not use company email for activities that could harm Acme Corp's reputation, compromise data security, violate legal or ethical standards, or disrupt the work environment. Prohibited uses include:

*   Transmitting or storing illegal, discriminatory, harassing, or offensive content.
*   Engaging in unauthorized commercial activities or personal profit-making ventures.
*   Subscribing to unverified, illicit, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Sending unsolicited bulk messages (spam) or chain letters.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company, client, or employee information without explicit authorization.
*   Attempting to bypass security measures or access unauthorized systems.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor email communications on its systems to ensure compliance with this policy and protect its interests.

**Personal Use**

Limited and reasonable personal use of company email is permitted, provided it does not:

*   Interfere with an employee's job duties or productivity.
*   Consume excessive network bandwidth or storage resources.
*   Violate any other company policies, including those related to data security and acceptable conduct.
*   Examples of permissible personal use include registering for work-appropriate online courses, brief communications with family in emergencies, or accessing safe and appropriate online content during designated breaks.

**Email Security**

Email remains a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Employees are mandated to prioritize email security to protect themselves and the company. Employees must:

*   Set strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and update them regularly (e.g., every 90 days).
*   Never share email passwords or account credentials with anyone.
*   Be vigilant against suspicious emails, especially those requesting personal information, login credentials, or containing unexpected attachments or links.
*   Immediately report any suspected phishing attempts, unusual email activity, or security incidents to the IT Security team.
*   Ensure that anti-malware and security software on company-issued devices are up-to-date.
*   Avoid opening attachments or clicking links from unknown or untrusted senders.

**Email Signature**

A standardized professional email signature is required for all external communications to maintain a consistent corporate image and brand identity. The signature should include:

*   Employee's Full Name
*   Job Title
*   Department
*   Acme Corp (with official company website link)
*   Official Contact Number
*   Company Address

Employees should consult the Marketing or IT department for approved templates and guidelines on incorporating company logos or legal disclaimers.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Any violation of this Company Email Usage Policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may range from formal warnings and mandatory retraining to suspension or termination of employment, depending on the severity, frequency, and impact of the infraction. Serious breaches, particularly those involving unauthorized disclosure of confidential data, legal non-compliance, or significant harm to the company's reputation or systems, may also lead to legal action.
