# Company Cyber Security Policy

**Policy brief & purpose**

At Acme Corp, our cyber security policy outlines comprehensive guidelines and provisions to safeguard our invaluable data assets and technology infrastructure. As a leading Information Technology company with 10,000 employees, we recognize that our reliance on technology for innovation, client service, and operational efficiency exposes us to evolving cyber threats. Human error, sophisticated attacks, and system vulnerabilities can lead to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and compromise client trust.

This policy establishes a robust framework of security measures and clear instructions to mitigate these risks, ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of our information systems.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, interns, and any third-party personnel who have permanent or temporary access to our systems, networks, devices, or data, regardless of their location or the device used.

**Policy elements**

**Confidential Data**

Confidential data at Acme Corp is proprietary, sensitive, and critical to our business operations and client relationships. This includes, but is not limited to:
*   Proprietary software, algorithms, and source code
*   Client project specifications, intellectual property, and personal data
*   Unpublished financial reports, strategic plans, and market research
*   Employee personal information and HR records
*   Trade secrets and competitive intelligence

All personnel are obligated to protect this data diligently. The following sections provide instructions on how to prevent security breaches related to confidential information.

**Protect Personal and Company Devices**

When accessing Acme Corp's network or data, all devices, whether company-issued or personal (under our BYOD policy), must adhere to strict security standards. Employees are required to:
*   Ensure all devices are protected with strong, unique passwords or biometric authentication.
*   Activate multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all company accounts.
*   Install and regularly update approved antivirus and anti-malware software.
*   Keep operating systems, applications, and browsers patched with the latest security updates.
*   Never leave devices unattended or unsecured in public or shared spaces.
*   Access company systems and data only through secure, private networks or approved Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
*   For company-issued devices, follow all instructions for disk encryption and Mobile Device Management (MDM) setup provided by the IT Security team.

**Keep Emails Safe**

Emails are a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and ransomware. To prevent infection or data theft, employees must:
*   Exercise extreme caution with unsolicited emails, especially those containing attachments or links. Do not open them if the sender or content seems suspicious or inadequately explained.
*   Be wary of emails with urgent or enticing subject lines (e.g., "Account Suspended," "Prize Notification").
*   Verify the sender's email address and name for legitimacy, looking for subtle misspellings or unusual domains.
*   Identify stylistic red flags such as grammatical errors, excessive punctuation, or inconsistent formatting.
*   Report any suspicious emails immediately to the IT Security team using the designated reporting tool.

**Manage Passwords Properly**

Compromised passwords are a significant security risk. Employees are advised to:
*   Create complex passwords of at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information or easily guessable sequences.
*   Utilize Acme Corp's approved password manager to generate and securely store unique passwords for different accounts.
*   Never share passwords with anyone, including colleagues or IT support.
*   Change passwords for critical systems every 90 days or immediately if a compromise is suspected.

**Transfer Data Securely**

Data transfer, especially of sensitive information, introduces security vulnerabilities. Employees must:
*   Avoid transferring confidential data (e.g., client information, proprietary designs) to unapproved personal devices or external accounts unless explicitly authorized and necessary for job functions.
*   Use only approved, encrypted company networks and secure cloud storage solutions for sharing sensitive data. Public Wi-Fi networks should never be used for such transfers without a secure VPN.
*   Ensure that recipients of data are authorized individuals or organizations with adequate data protection policies in place.
*   Consult the IT Security team for guidance on mass transfers of sensitive data.

**Report Scams, Privacy Breaches and Hacking Attempts**

Every employee is a critical component of Acme Corp's security posture. Prompt reporting of potential threats is essential. Employees are required to:
*   Report any perceived cyberattacks, suspicious emails, phishing attempts, or privacy breaches to the IT Security team immediately.
*   The IT Security team will promptly investigate all reports, resolve issues, and issue company-wide alerts when necessary.
*   Acme Corp's IT Security specialists are available to advise employees on threat detection and best practices.

**Additional Measures**

To further enhance our security posture, Acme Corp also instructs employees to:
*   Lock their computer screens and secure devices when stepping away from their workstations.
*   Report stolen or damaged company equipment to HR and IT immediately (within 2 hours).
*   Change all account passwords associated with a stolen device without delay.
*   Refrain from downloading or installing unauthorized, suspicious, or illegal software on company equipment.
*   Avoid accessing suspicious or unverified websites.

Our IT Security team is responsible for:
*   Implementing and maintaining robust firewalls, intrusion detection systems, anti-malware solutions, and access authentication systems.
*   Conducting regular security awareness training for all employees.
*   Providing timely updates on new threats, scams, and best practices.
*   Thoroughly investigating all security incidents.
*   Adhering to all provisions of this policy as other employees do.
*   Acme Corp maintains physical and digital safeguards to protect all information assets.

**Remote Employees**

Remote employees are integral to Acme Corp's operations and must adhere strictly to this policy. Given the distributed nature of their work, they are specifically required to:
*   Ensure their home networks are secured with strong Wi-Fi passwords and up-to-date router firmware.
*   Always use Acme Corp's VPN when accessing company resources.
*   Maintain physical security of company devices and documents in their remote workspace, preventing unauthorized access by household members or visitors.
*   Seek guidance from the IT Security team for any concerns regarding remote work security.

**Disciplinary Action**

Acme Corp expects all employees to comply with this policy diligently. Violations may result in disciplinary action, which can range from verbal warnings to immediate termination of employment, depending on the severity and nature of the breach.
*   **First-time, unintentional, small-scale security breach:** May result in a verbal warning and mandatory re-training on security protocols.
*   **Intentional, repeated, or large-scale breaches (causing severe financial or other damage):** Will lead to more severe disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of employment and potential legal action.

Employees observed to disregard security instructions, even without a direct breach, will face progressive discipline. Each incident will be examined on a case-by-case basis.

**Take security seriously**

The trust of our clients, partners, and employees is paramount. Proactively protecting our systems and data is a collective responsibility. Every individual at Acme Corp must remain vigilant and prioritize cybersecurity in all daily activities. We encourage all employees to contribute to a secure environment by being mindful of potential threats and speaking up when concerns arise.
