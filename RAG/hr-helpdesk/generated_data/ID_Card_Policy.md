## Company Email Usage Policy

### POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE

At Acme Corp, corporate email is a fundamental tool for professional communication and collaboration. This policy outlines the expectations and guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of company-provided email accounts. Our objective is to ensure that all email communications uphold Acme Corp's professional standards, protect sensitive information, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements, thereby safeguarding our reputation and technological infrastructure.

### SCOPE

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties who are granted access to or use Acme Corp's email systems, whether individually assigned or departmental. This includes all email accounts hosted on Acme Corp's servers or used for official company business, regardless of the device or network used to access them.

### COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY

Acme Corp's email system is a powerful communication asset provided to facilitate business operations. While employees are granted a degree of flexibility, all usage must align with company values and security protocols.

#### Correct Use of Corporate Email

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email accounts for all work-related activities without undue restriction. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and other external stakeholders.
*   Internal collaboration and information sharing among colleagues and teams.
*   Accessing and registering for business-critical software, platforms, and online services.
*   Professional networking and engagement at industry events or conferences.
*   Subscribing to professional newsletters, industry updates, or educational resources relevant to their role and professional development.

#### Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email

When utilizing an Acme Corp email address, employees are representing the organization. Therefore, certain uses are strictly prohibited to protect our integrity, security, and legal standing:

*   Sending or forwarding content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, defamatory, or sexually explicit.
*   Registering for or accessing websites, services, or platforms that are unreliable, illegal, or disrereputable, especially those that could compromise company security or data.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company, client, or partner information without proper authorization.
*   Engaging in activities that violate intellectual property rights, including unauthorized sharing of copyrighted material.
*   Using company email for personal financial gain, political lobbying, or extensive personal business ventures.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all corporate email communications for compliance with this policy and for security purposes.

#### Personal Use

Acme Corp acknowledges that employees may occasionally use their corporate email for limited personal purposes. Such use is permitted provided it is infrequent, does not interfere with job duties, and adheres to all other aspects of this policy. Examples of acceptable personal use include:

*   Registering for professional development courses, webinars, or industry meetups.
*   Brief communications with family and friends, ensuring no confidential company information is disclosed.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate educational materials, e-books, or guides for personal growth.

#### Email Security

Email remains a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Employees must exercise vigilance to protect Acme Corp's systems and data.

*   **Password Management:** Employees must create strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, comprising a minimum of eight characters including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords should not contain personal information (e.g., birthdays) and must be changed every 90 days. Writing down passwords is discouraged; employees should utilize approved password managers if needed.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:** Employees are instructed to be highly cautious of suspicious emails. This includes:
    *   Never opening attachments or clicking on links from unknown or untrusted senders, or when the content is inadequately explained.
    *   Being wary of "clickbait" titles or urgent requests for information.
    *   Verifying the sender's email address and name for legitimacy, looking for subtle misspellings or inconsistencies.
    *   Identifying style red flags such as poor grammar, excessive punctuation, or unusual formatting.
*   **Reporting:** If an employee suspects an email is unsafe or a phishing attempt, they must immediately report it to the IT Security team and avoid interacting with it.
*   **Software Updates:** Employees are responsible for ensuring their anti-malware and security software on company-issued devices is regularly updated.

#### Email Signature

Employees are encouraged to maintain a professional and consistent email signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand identity. Sales and executive personnel, in particular, should pay close attention to their closing. A standard format is:

`[Employee Name]`
`[Employee Title], [Department]`
`Acme Corp | [Company Website Link]`
`[Phone Number] | [Company Address]`

Images, company logos, and links to work-related content may be included, provided they are approved by the Marketing or IT department. Assistance with signature setup is available from the IT Helpdesk or direct supervisors.

### DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES

Failure to comply with this Email Usage Policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Examples of violations that may lead to such consequences include:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential company, client, or partner information via email.
*   Sending inappropriate, offensive, or harassing emails to colleagues, clients, or external parties.
*   Using corporate email for illegal activities or to facilitate fraudulent schemes.
*   Repeated or severe breaches of email security protocols, such as falling victim to phishing due to negligence.

Each violation will be investigated on a case-by-case basis, and the severity of the disciplinary action will be commensurate with the nature and impact of the offense.
