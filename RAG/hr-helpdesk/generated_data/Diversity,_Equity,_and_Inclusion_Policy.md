# Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This policy establishes guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of company email accounts by Acme Corp employees. It aims to protect sensitive information, maintain professional communication standards, and ensure compliance with data security protocols, thereby safeguarding the company's reputation and technological assets.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all permanent, temporary, and contract employees, as well as third-party vendors and consultants who are granted access to Acme Corp's email systems or use company email addresses for business communication. This includes individual and departmental email accounts, regardless of the device used for access.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Company email is a vital communication tool provided for official business purposes. While employees are afforded some flexibility for personal use, adherence to these guidelines is mandatory.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email for activities directly related to their job functions and the company's objectives, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and colleagues for business operations.
*   Accessing necessary software, platforms, and online services required for professional development or job execution.
*   Representing Acme Corp in external communications, conferences, and professional networking events.
*   Receiving official company communications and updates.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using corporate email, employees represent Acme Corp. Therefore, they must not engage in activities that could harm the company's image, security, or legal standing. Prohibited uses include:

*   Transmitting discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or defamatory content towards any individual or group.
*   Engaging in unauthorized political lobbying, commercial solicitations, or chain letters.
*   Registering for unverified, illicit, or disreputable online services or websites.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information without explicit, documented authorization.
*   Creating or forwarding content that violates copyright laws or intellectual property rights.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all corporate email communications for compliance with this policy and for security purposes.

**Personal Use**

Employees are permitted limited personal use of their corporate email, provided it does not:

*   Interfere with work duties or productivity.
*   Violate any other company policies, including those related to data security and professional conduct.
*   Involve excessive bandwidth consumption or storage usage.
*   Examples include: registering for professional development courses, sending brief personal messages to family or friends, or subscribing to industry-relevant newsletters.

**Email Security**

Email systems are frequent targets for cyber threats. Employees must exercise extreme caution to protect company data and infrastructure.

*   **Password Management:** Employees must use strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, adhering to Acme Corp's password complexity requirements (minimum 12 characters, combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols). Passwords should be changed every 90 days and not be reused.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Employees are required to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) where available for their email accounts.
*   **Phishing and Malware Awareness:**
    *   Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or suspicious senders.
    *   Be wary of emails requesting personal information, login credentials, or financial details.
    *   Verify the sender's identity and email address for any unusual or unexpected messages.
    *   Report any suspected phishing attempts or suspicious emails immediately to the IT Security team.
*   **Device Security:** Ensure that any device used to access company email (company-issued or personal) is protected with up-to-date antivirus software, firewalls, and operating system security patches.
*   **Confidentiality:** Do not forward company emails containing sensitive information to personal email accounts or unsecured external recipients.

**Email Signature**

All outgoing external emails must include a standardized professional signature, as provided by the Marketing or IT department. This signature typically contains:

*   Employee's Full Name
*   Job Title
*   Department
*   Acme Corp (with official company link)
*   Official Phone Number (optional)
*   Company Address

Personal quotes, unapproved images, or non-business-related links are prohibited in official email signatures. Employees unsure about signature creation should consult their manager or the IT department.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Violations of this Email Usage Policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may range from formal warnings and mandatory retraining to suspension or termination of employment, depending on the severity and impact of the breach. Serious breaches, particularly those involving data security, legal non-compliance, or significant reputational damage, may also lead to legal action in accordance with applicable Indian laws.
