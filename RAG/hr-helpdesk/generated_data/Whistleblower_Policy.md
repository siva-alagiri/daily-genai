# Hybrid Work Model Policy

**Effective Date:** [Current Date]

**Overview and Purpose**

At Acme Corp, we believe in fostering a dynamic and supportive work environment that empowers our 10,000-strong workforce to achieve their best, both professionally and personally. This Hybrid Work Model Policy outlines our approach to flexible work arrangements, designed to balance operational efficiency, team collaboration, and individual well-being. We aim to leverage the benefits of both in-office interaction and remote flexibility to enhance productivity, attract and retain top talent in the Information Technology sector, and promote a sustainable work-life integration for our employees across India.

**Policy Framework**

**Introduction to the Flexible Work Model:**
Acme Corp recognizes the evolving landscape of modern work. Our flexible work policy, "AcmeFlex," is a strategic initiative that provides our employees with options for where and how they work, fostering a mobile, collaborative, and adaptable work setting. This framework supports our commitment to innovation and employee empowerment.

**Policy Objectives:**
*   To enhance business resilience and agility in a rapidly changing IT environment.
*   To support our goals in talent acquisition and retention by offering competitive flexibility.
*   To contribute to environmental sustainability by minimizing daily commuting.
*   To promote a healthy work-life balance and overall employee satisfaction.
*   To maintain strong team cohesion and effective communication regardless of physical location.

**Hybrid Working Categories**

Acme Corp acknowledges that different roles and individual circumstances require varied approaches to hybrid work. The following categories define our flexible work models:

*   **Remote-Focused:** Roles primarily performed off-site, with mandatory in-office presence only when specific tasks, team meetings, or client engagements necessitate physical attendance. This model is suitable for roles with minimal on-site dependency.
*   **Office-Intermittent:** Employees primarily work remotely but are expected to be in the office on a regular, pre-agreed schedule (e.g., 2-3 days a week). The frequency of office presence must be mutually agreed upon with the employee's manager to ensure team collaboration and project alignment.
*   **Office-Focused, Remote Permitted:** The primary work location remains the office, but occasional remote work is allowed with prior manager approval. This model is for roles where consistent in-office presence is generally required but offers flexibility for specific circumstances.

**Eligibility and Implementation**

**Eligibility Criteria:**
All roles at Acme Corp will be assessed for suitability within the hybrid work model based on:
*   The ability to maintain high productivity and effective collaboration remotely.
*   The nature of job responsibilities, including the need for specialized on-site equipment or direct client interaction.
*   Team and departmental operational requirements.
*   Consistent strong performance and adherence to company policies.
Employees are encouraged to discuss their interest in AcmeFlex with their direct managers to understand if their role qualifies and to explore suitable arrangements.

**Leader Approval:**
All flexible work arrangements under AcmeFlex require explicit approval from the employee's direct manager and subsequent endorsement by the Department Head. This ensures alignment with team objectives, project timelines, and overall organizational goals.

**Remote Work Environment:**
Employees participating in AcmeFlex are responsible for establishing a dedicated workspace that is safe, ergonomic, and conducive to productivity, free from significant distractions. Acme Corp will provide guidelines and resources on setting up a home office that meets health and safety standards.

**Support and Resources**

**Technology and Infrastructure:**
Acme Corp will provide the necessary technology and support to facilitate efficient remote work. This includes:
*   Company-issued laptops or desktop computers.
*   Access to essential software and secure company networks (VPN).
*   Guidelines for requesting additional approved equipment or tools necessary for remote work.

**Security Measures:**
Employees are required to strictly adhere to Acme Corp's data protection, information security, and confidentiality policies. This includes secure use of company networks, safeguarding company data, and careful handling of sensitive information at all times, regardless of work location.

**Health and Safety:**
Acme Corp and its employees share the responsibility for ensuring a safe and healthy work environment. Employees are expected to follow ergonomic best practices, take regular breaks, and report any workplace injuries or hazards (even in a remote setting) to their manager and HR promptly.

**Roles and Responsibilities**

**Employees must:**

*   Ensure their designated workspace is conducive to productivity and free from distractions.

**Leaders must:**
*   Regularly check in with their team members, providing consistent support, feedback, and guidance.

**Expected Hours of Attendance and Availability**

**Permanent Staff Members:** All full-time employees, regardless of their work model, are expected to dedicate 40 hours per week to their roles. Mandatory in-office attendance for all-hands meetings, team-building events, or critical project phases will be communicated with reasonable advance notice.

**Employees Working from Home:** Employees are trusted to successfully complete their tasks. To ensure effective collaboration and availability in a remote setting, employees must:
*   Maintain an updated calendar reflecting their working hours, breaks, and availability.
*   Actively use designated communication platforms (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack) to indicate their status (e.g., "Available," "In a Meeting," "Away").
*   Participate in scheduled virtual stand-ups and team meetings.

**Full-time Hybrid Workers:** Employees on an office-intermittent schedule are required to be in the office for a minimum of [e.g., two to three] days each week, as agreed with their manager. Department heads will establish optimal in-office days for their teams to enhance internal communication and ensure availability for collaborative activities.

**Hourly Workers Working from Home:** Hourly employees must maintain detailed and accurate time logs of their work using the company's designated time-tracking system. These logs must be submitted to their supervisors for review to ensure accurate compensation. Acme Corp will compensate employees for all hours worked, including overtime, in accordance with applicable Indian labor laws. This applies to remote work, provided there is knowledge or reasonable suspicion that work is genuinely being performed. Clocking in and out via the approved timekeeping application is mandatory.

**Miscellaneous**

When working from any designated workplace, all policies outlined in the Acme Corp Employee Handbook, including but not limited to policies preventing harassment, regulations requiring confidentiality, and policies governing attendance, must be adhered to.

Employees are reminded that the AcmeFlex policy is not intended to be utilized in lieu of paid sick leave, casual leave, or any other type of approved leave.

There have been no changes made to any of our policies regarding the benefits and compensation of our employees as a result of this policy, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

**Severance of Agreement**

The flexible work arrangement under AcmeFlex may be reviewed, modified, or terminated at any time, for any reason, by either Acme Corp or the employee, with appropriate notice. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions outlined in this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

**Policy Review and Adaptation**

Acme Corp is committed to the success and well-being of our employees. This policy will be reviewed annually, or as needed, to adapt to changing business needs, technological advancements, and feedback from our team. Employees and leaders are encouraged to provide input to continuously improve our hybrid work model.
