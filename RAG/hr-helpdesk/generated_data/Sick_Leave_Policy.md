**AI Tool Usage Policy**

**Purpose**

This AI Tool Usage Policy establishes the framework for the responsible, ethical, and secure utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and platforms across Acme Corp. Its aim is to harness the benefits of AI while upholding our company's values, safeguarding data integrity, and ensuring adherence to all applicable legal and regulatory standards in India.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third-party personnel who access, develop, or deploy AI tools on behalf of Acme Corp, regardless of their role or location.

**Ethical Use of AI**

*   **Fairness and Equity:** AI systems must be designed and applied to promote equitable outcomes, actively identifying and mitigating biases that could lead to discriminatory results. Users are responsible for critically evaluating AI outputs for potential unfairness.
*   **Transparency and Explainability:** Where AI influences decisions impacting individuals or critical business processes, Acme Corp is committed to understanding and, where feasible, explaining the basis of those AI-driven recommendations.
*   **Accountability:** Human judgment remains paramount. Employees using AI tools are ultimately accountable for the decisions made and actions taken, even when assisted by AI. AI is a support mechanism, not a substitute for human responsibility.

**Data Privacy and Security**

*   **Data Protection:** All data processed by AI tools must comply with Acme Corp's Data Protection Policy and relevant Indian data privacy laws, including the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP Act) once enacted. Personal or sensitive company data must not be input into unauthorized AI tools.
*   **Data Security:** Robust security measures, including encryption, access controls, and secure storage, must be implemented for all data utilized by or generated from AI tools to prevent unauthorized access, breaches, or misuse.

**User Training and Awareness**

*   **Training:** Employees authorized to use AI tools will receive mandatory training covering their capabilities, limitations, potential biases, and secure interaction protocols. This includes guidance on effective prompt engineering and output validation.
*   **Awareness:** Users must maintain continuous awareness of the evolving AI landscape, potential risks, and best practices for ethical and secure AI engagement.

**Decision-Making and Human Oversight**

*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Critical business decisions, especially those with significant impact on customers, employees, or company operations, must always involve human review and final approval, even when AI provides recommendations.
*   **Validation and Review:** Regular validation of AI tool performance and periodic audits of AI-generated outputs will be conducted to ensure accuracy, identify anomalies, and address any unintended consequences.

**Vendor and Tool Selection**

*   **Due Diligence:** A thorough due diligence process will be undertaken for all AI vendors and tools. This includes evaluating their data security practices, compliance certifications, ethical AI principles, and data handling agreements.
*   **Contractual Agreements:** Contracts with AI service providers must include explicit clauses addressing data ownership, confidentiality, security standards, audit rights, and liability for data breaches or AI system failures.

**Compliance**

*   **Legal and Regulatory Adherence:** The use of AI tools must strictly comply with all applicable Indian laws and regulations concerning data privacy, intellectual property, consumer protection, and ethical technology use.
*   **Policy Adherence:** All employees are required to adhere to this AI Tool Usage Policy. Violations may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

**Continuous Improvement**

*   **Feedback Mechanism:** Employees are encouraged to report any concerns, potential risks, or suggestions related to AI tool usage to their manager or the designated AI Governance Committee.
*   **Policy Review:** This policy will be reviewed and updated at least annually, or as necessitated by technological advancements, changes in regulatory landscape, or internal operational requirements.
