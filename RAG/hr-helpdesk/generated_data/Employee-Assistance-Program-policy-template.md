This Work-From-Home (WFH) Policy outlines the framework and expectations for employees who are approved to perform their job duties remotely. It aims to provide clarity on eligibility, responsibilities, and procedures to maintain high standards of performance, collaboration, and data security in a distributed work model.

**2. Eligibility**

This policy applies to all permanent full-time and part-time employees of Acme Corp. Eligibility for remote work arrangements will be determined based on the following criteria:

*   **Performance Record:** Employees must have a consistent record of strong performance, reliability, and adherence to company policies.
*   **Team and Business Needs:** The remote work arrangement must align with the operational requirements of the team and department, ensuring no adverse impact on project delivery or critical functions.
*   **Managerial Discretion:** Final approval rests with the employee's direct manager and department head, in consultation with HR.

**3. Approval Process**

Employees interested in a WFH arrangement must follow these steps:
*   **Formal Request:** Submit a written request to their direct manager, outlining the proposed WFH schedule, justification, and how performance and collaboration will be maintained.
*   **Manager Review:** The manager will assess the request against eligibility criteria, team needs, and potential impact on project timelines.
*   **HR Consultation:** The manager will consult with the Human Resources department for policy adherence and consistency.
*   **Final Approval:** Upon joint approval from the manager and HR, the employee will receive a formal WFH agreement outlining the terms and conditions.

*   **Secure Environment:** Employees must ensure their home workspace is secure, protecting company assets and confidential information from unauthorized access. This includes using a secure, private internet connection and adhering to all cybersecurity protocols.
*   **Data Protection:** All company data accessed or stored remotely must be handled in strict accordance with Acme Corp's Data Protection and Cybersecurity policies. Use of company-issued VPN and secure access tools is mandatory.
*   **Reporting Issues:** Any loss, damage, or security breach of company equipment or data must be reported immediately to the IT Helpdesk and their manager.

**5. Work Hours**

*   **Standard Hours:** Remote employees are expected to adhere to their regular working hours as defined in their employment contract, unless alternative arrangements are formally approved.

*   **Proactive Engagement:** Remote employees are expected to maintain regular and proactive communication with their managers, team members, and stakeholders.
*   **Tools:** Utilize company-approved communication and collaboration platforms (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack, video conferencing tools) for daily interactions, meetings, and project updates.
*   **Responsiveness:** Timely responses to emails, messages, and calls during working hours are crucial for effective remote collaboration.

**7. Productivity and Performance**

*   **Consistent Expectations:** Performance standards and expectations for remote employees are identical to those for in-office employees.
*   **Outcome-Oriented:** Emphasis will be placed on deliverables, project milestones, and measurable outcomes rather than physical presence.

*   **Self-Assessment:** Employees are encouraged to conduct a self-assessment of their home office setup to identify and mitigate potential health and safety risks.
*   **Incident Reporting:** Any work-related injuries or incidents occurring in the remote workspace must be reported immediately to their manager and HR.

**9. Expenses**

*   **Approved Expenses:** Acme Corp will reimburse employees for pre-approved, reasonable business expenses directly related to their remote work, in accordance with the company's Employee Business Expense Policy.
*   **Documentation:** All claims must be supported by valid receipts and submitted through the designated expense management system.
*   **Non-Reimbursable:** Personal expenses, general household utilities, or internet costs (unless specifically agreed upon as a WFH allowance) are typically not reimbursable.
