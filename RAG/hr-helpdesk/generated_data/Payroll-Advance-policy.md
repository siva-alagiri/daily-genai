## Workplace Nepotism Policy

### 1. Policy Statement

Acme Corp is committed to fostering a fair, transparent, and merit-based work environment where all employees are treated equitably and have equal opportunities for career advancement. This policy is established to prevent and address nepotism, ensuring that employment decisions are based solely on qualifications, performance, and business needs, free from any undue influence or perceived favoritism arising from personal relationships.

### 2. Objective

The primary objectives of this policy are to:
*   Clearly define nepotism and establish guidelines to prevent its occurrence within Acme Corp.
*   Outline prohibited relationships and circumstances that could lead to conflicts of interest.
*   Provide a clear framework for managing and resolving potential conflicts arising from personal relationships in the workplace.
*   Maintain a professional and objective decision-making process in all employment-related matters.

### 3. Scope

This policy applies to all individuals associated with Acme Corp, including full-time, part-time, temporary employees, contractors, interns, and volunteers, regardless of their position or department. It covers all employment activities, including recruitment, hiring, transfers, promotions, compensation, and performance management.

### 4. Definition of Nepotism

Nepotism is defined as the practice of showing favoritism or granting preferential treatment to relatives or individuals with whom one has a close personal relationship, in employment decisions such as recruitment, hiring, promotion, transfer, compensation, or direct/indirect supervision within Acme Corp.

### 5. Prohibited Relationships

For the purpose of this policy, "prohibited relationships" include, but are not limited to:
*   Spouses or domestic partners
*   Parents and children (biological, adopted, or step)
*   Siblings (biological, adopted, or step)
*   Grandparents and grandchildren
*   Aunts, uncles, nieces, and nephews
*   In-laws (through marriage or domestic partnership)
*   Any other close personal relationship where one individual could exert influence over the employment decisions or work environment of another.

### 6. Conflicts of Interest

Employees are required to disclose any existing or potential personal relationships that could create a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest in the workplace. Failure to disclose such relationships may result in disciplinary action. A conflict of interest arises when a personal relationship could interfere with an employee's ability to act impartially and in the best interest of Acme Corp.

### 7. Recruitment and Hiring

*   Supervisors, hiring managers, and any employee involved in the recruitment process must disclose any prohibited relationship with a job applicant.
*   Decisions related to recruitment and hiring must be based exclusively on the applicant's qualifications, skills, experience, and suitability for the role, as well as the company's business needs.
*   No applicant will receive preferential treatment due to a relationship with an existing employee.
*   In instances where a qualified candidate has a prohibited relationship with an existing employee, the hiring decision will be made by an independent panel or a manager at a higher organizational level, ensuring objectivity.

### 8. Transfer and Promotion

*   Decisions regarding employee transfers and promotions will be made impartially, based on merit, performance, qualifications, and the strategic needs of the company.
*   Employees in a prohibited relationship will not be eligible for transfer or promotion to a position where one would directly or indirectly supervise the other, or where one would have influence over the other's performance, compensation, or career progression.

### 9. Supervision and Reporting Relationships

*   Employees in a prohibited relationship are strictly prohibited from being in a direct or indirect supervisory or reporting relationship. This includes situations where one employee has the authority to hire, fire, promote, discipline, or influence the compensation or work assignments of the other.
*   If such a relationship develops or is discovered, the involved employees and their managers must immediately report it to Human Resources. HR, in consultation with relevant management, will determine appropriate reassignments or structural changes to eliminate the conflict of interest.

### 10. Disciplinary Actions

Any violation of this policy, including failure to disclose a prohibited relationship or engaging in preferential treatment, may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, depending on the severity and recurrence of the violation.

### 11. Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy may be considered only in rare and exceptional circumstances where a strict application of the policy would create an undue hardship for the company or the individuals involved, and where the potential for conflict of interest can be effectively mitigated. All exceptions must be approved in writing by the Head of Human Resources and a member of the Senior Leadership Team.

### 12. Review and Updates

This policy will be reviewed annually or as needed to ensure its continued relevance, effectiveness, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any amendments will be communicated to all employees through official company channels.

### 13. Definitions
