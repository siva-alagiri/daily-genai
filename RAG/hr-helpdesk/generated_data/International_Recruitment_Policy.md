# Work-From-Home Policy

**Effective Date:** [Current Date]

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Work-From-Home (WFH) Policy is to establish clear guidelines and expectations for employees of Acme Corp who are approved to perform their job responsibilities remotely. This policy aims to foster a flexible work environment that supports employee well-being, enhances productivity, ensures business continuity, and leverages modern technology while maintaining the security and integrity of company operations.

## 2. Eligibility

Eligibility for remote work arrangements at Acme Corp is determined based on the nature of the role, job responsibilities, individual performance, and departmental operational requirements. Not all roles are suitable for remote work, and WFH is not an inherent employee right or entitlement.
Criteria for eligibility include:
*   The role's functions can be effectively performed outside the traditional office environment.
*   The employee has consistently met performance expectations and demonstrated strong self-management skills.
*   The employee has a suitable and secure home workspace conducive to productivity.
*   Managerial approval, considering team dynamics and project needs.

## 3. Approval Process

Employees interested in a Work-From-Home arrangement must submit a formal request through the designated HR Information System (HRIS) to their immediate supervisor.
The approval process involves:
*   **Employee Request:** Submission of a detailed request outlining the proposed WFH schedule, justification, and confirmation of a suitable work environment.
*   **Manager Review:** The supervisor will evaluate the request based on role suitability, team impact, performance history, and departmental needs.
*   **HR Review & Final Approval:** The Human Resources department will review the request for policy compliance and consistency, providing final approval or denial.
*   Requests should ideally be submitted with at least [e.g., two weeks'] notice for planned WFH days. For long-term or hybrid arrangements, a more extensive review period may apply.

## 4. Equipment and Security

### 4.1 Employee Responsibilities
Employees working remotely are responsible for maintaining the utmost security and confidentiality of Acme Corp's information and assets. This includes:
*   Adhering strictly to Acme Corp's Cybersecurity Policy and Data Protection Policy.
*   Ensuring all company-issued devices are password-protected and kept secure from unauthorized access.
*   Using Acme Corp's Virtual Private Network (VPN) or other approved secure access methods for all company-related work.
*   Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized disclosure, whether accidental or intentional.
*   Maintaining a secure and private workspace to prevent unauthorized viewing or listening.

### 4.2 Company Provision
Acme Corp will provide necessary equipment and resources for remote work, typically including:
*   Company-issued laptops or desktop computers.
*   Access to required software and secure network resources.
*   Guidelines for setting up an ergonomic and safe home office environment.
*   Use of personal devices for company work is generally discouraged unless explicitly approved by IT and secured according to company standards.

## 5. Work Hours

Remote employees are expected to adhere to their regular work hours as defined by their employment contract and departmental requirements. Flexibility within core working hours may be permitted with prior manager approval, ensuring team collaboration and client service are not compromised. Employees are responsible for accurately tracking their working hours as per company policy. Overtime policies remain applicable to remote employees and must be pre-approved by their manager.

## 6. Communication

Effective and timely communication is paramount for successful remote work. Remote employees must:
*   Maintain regular and proactive communication with their supervisors and team members.
*   Be accessible and responsive during their designated working hours via official communication channels (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack, company email, phone).
*   Actively participate in virtual meetings and team collaborations.
*   Inform their manager promptly of any connectivity issues or unexpected absences.

## 7. Productivity and Performance

Performance expectations for remote employees are consistent with those for in-office employees. Managers will set clear objectives and monitor deliverables. Regular performance reviews and check-ins will be conducted to ensure accountability, productivity, and professional development. Any concerns regarding performance or productivity in a remote setting will be addressed through standard performance management processes.

## 8. Health and Safety

Employees are responsible for maintaining a safe and ergonomic work environment at their remote location. Acme Corp encourages employees to take regular breaks and practice good posture. While Acme Corp is committed to employee well-being, the company is not liable for injuries or incidents that occur in the employee's personal remote workspace, unless directly related to company-provided equipment or work-related tasks as per applicable Indian labor laws. Employees must report any work-related incidents or hazards to their manager and HR immediately.

## 9. Expenses

Acme Corp will reimburse employees for approved, business-related expenses incurred while working remotely, in accordance with the Company's Business Expense Policy. This may include a reasonable stipend for internet connectivity or a contribution towards utility costs, as per specific guidelines communicated by HR. Employees must submit expense reports with valid receipts through the HRIS for approval and reimbursement.

## 10. Termination of Remote Work Agreement

Acme Corp reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate any remote work arrangement at any time, with or without notice, based on business needs, changes in job responsibilities, performance concerns, or non-compliance with this policy or other company policies.

## 11. Confidentiality

Remote employees must strictly adhere to all Acme Corp's Confidentiality and Data Protection Policies. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive company, client, or employee information, regardless of intent, will result in severe disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and potential legal action.

## 12. Compliance

Remote employees must comply with all applicable Indian labor laws and regulations, as well as all Acme Corp policies and procedures, including but not limited to the Code of Conduct, Cybersecurity Policy, and Data Protection Policy, while working remotely.

## 13. Acknowledgment

By participating in the Work-From-Home program, employees acknowledge their understanding and agreement to comply with all the terms and conditions outlined in this policy.

## 14. Review and Updates
