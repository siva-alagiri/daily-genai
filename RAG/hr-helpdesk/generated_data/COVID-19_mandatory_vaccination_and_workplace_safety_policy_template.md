## Cyber Security Policy

**Policy brief & purpose**

Acme Corp's Cyber Security Policy outlines our comprehensive guidelines and provisions for safeguarding our digital assets, proprietary information, and technology infrastructure. As a leading Information Technology company, the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of our data are paramount to our operations, client trust, and competitive advantage. This policy is designed to protect against evolving cyber threats, human error, and system vulnerabilities that could lead to significant financial, reputational, and operational damage. We are committed to maintaining a secure digital environment and have established clear instructions to mitigate security risks.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, interns, and any third parties who have permanent or temporary access to our systems, networks, applications, and hardware, regardless of their location or device ownership (company-issued or personal).

**Policy elements**

**Confidential Data**

Confidential data at Acme Corp is defined as any information that is secret, valuable, and not intended for public disclosure. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Proprietary software code, algorithms, and development plans.
*   Client data, project specifications, and intellectual property.
*   Unpublished financial records, business strategies, and market research.
*   Employee personal information and HR records.
*   Security protocols, network configurations, and system vulnerabilities.
*   Any information explicitly marked as "Confidential" or "Proprietary."

All individuals covered by this policy are obligated to protect this data with the highest level of care.

**Protect Personal and Company Devices**

Devices used to access Acme Corp's resources, whether company-issued or personal (under our BYOD policy), introduce potential security risks. All users must ensure their computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones are secure by:

*   Enabling strong password protection and multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all devices and accounts.
*   Installing and regularly updating approved antivirus/anti-malware software.
*   Ensuring devices are never left exposed or unattended in public or unsecured areas.
*   Applying security updates for operating systems, browsers, and applications promptly upon release.
*   Accessing company accounts and systems exclusively through secure, private networks or approved VPN connections.
*   Avoiding the use of public Wi-Fi for sensitive company work without a secure VPN.
*   Following all instructions provided by our IT Security team for disk encryption, secure configuration, and software installation.

**Keep Emails Safe**

Emails are a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and ransomware. To prevent infection and data breaches, employees must:

*   Exercise extreme caution with unsolicited emails, especially those containing attachments or links. Do not open them if the content is inadequately explained or appears suspicious.
*   Be wary of emails with urgent or sensational subject lines (clickbait) or those offering unexpected prizes or benefits.
*   Verify the sender's email address and name for legitimacy, looking for subtle misspellings or inconsistencies.
*   Identify style red flags such as grammatical errors, excessive punctuation, or unusual formatting.
*   Report any suspicious emails to the IT Security team immediately, rather than attempting to investigate them independently.

**Manage Passwords Properly**

Robust password management is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to our infrastructure. All users are required to:

*   Create unique, strong passwords of at least 12 characters, incorporating a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
*   Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names) or easily guessable sequences.
*   Utilize the company-provided password manager to generate and securely store complex passwords.
*   Never write down passwords in an unsecured location. If physical notes are necessary, they must be kept confidential and destroyed when no longer needed.
*   Never share credentials with anyone, including colleagues or IT support, unless explicitly instructed by IT Security for a verified, legitimate purpose.
*   Change passwords for critical systems every 90 days.

**Transfer Data Securely**

Secure data transfer is essential to prevent unauthorized interception or access. Employees must:

*   Avoid transferring sensitive data (e.g., client information, proprietary code, employee records) to personal devices or unapproved cloud storage services unless absolutely necessary and with explicit authorization from their manager and IT Security.
*   Utilize only approved, encrypted company networks and secure file transfer protocols for sharing confidential information.
*   Never use public Wi-Fi or unsecured personal connections for transferring sensitive data.
*   Ensure that recipients of data are authorized individuals or organizations with adequate security policies in place.
*   Consult the IT Security team for guidance on mass data transfers or when dealing with highly sensitive information.

**Report Scams, Privacy Breaches, and Hacking Attempts**

Prompt reporting of security incidents is vital for our IT Security team to respond effectively and protect our infrastructure. Employees are required to report:

*   Any perceived cyberattacks, suspicious emails, phishing attempts, or unusual system behavior.
*   Loss or theft of any device containing company data.
*   Any accidental disclosure of confidential information.
*   Any suspected privacy breaches or unauthorized access to data.

Reports should be made immediately to the IT Security team via [Dedicated Security Hotline/Email Address]. Our IT Security team will investigate promptly, resolve the issue, and issue company-wide alerts when necessary.

**Additional Measures**

To further enhance our cyber security posture, all employees are expected to:

*   Lock their screens and devices when stepping away from their workstations.
*   Report stolen or damaged equipment to HR and the IT Security team as soon as possible.
*   Change all account passwords immediately if a device is stolen or compromised.
*   Refrain from downloading or installing unauthorized, suspicious, or illegal software on company equipment.
*   Avoid accessing suspicious or unverified websites.
*   Adhere to role-based access controls, only accessing data and systems necessary for their job functions.
*   Participate in mandatory regular cyber security awareness training sessions.

Our IT Security team is responsible for:

*   Implementing and maintaining firewalls, intrusion detection systems, anti-malware solutions, and robust access authentication systems.
*   Conducting regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
*   Providing ongoing security training and updates on emerging threats.
*   Investigating all security incidents thoroughly and transparently.

**Remote Employees**

Remote employees are integral to Acme Corp and must adhere to all aspects of this policy. Specific considerations for remote work include:

*   Ensuring their home network is secured with a strong, unique password and up-to-date router firmware.
*   Using company-provided VPN for all access to internal resources.
*   Maintaining a dedicated, secure workspace free from unauthorized access to company information.
*   Consulting the IT Security team for any concerns regarding their remote setup or security.

**Disciplinary Action**

Acme Corp takes cyber security seriously. Any violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, and potential legal action, depending on the severity and impact of the breach.

*   **First-time, unintentional, small-scale security breach:** May result in a verbal warning, mandatory re-training on security protocols, and close monitoring.
*   **Intentional, repeated, or large-scale breaches (causing severe financial, reputational, or operational damage):** Will lead to immediate and severe disciplinary action, including suspension or termination of employment, and may involve legal proceedings.
*   Employees observed to consistently disregard security instructions, even without a direct breach, will face progressive discipline.

Each incident will be examined on a case-by-case basis by HR and IT Security.
