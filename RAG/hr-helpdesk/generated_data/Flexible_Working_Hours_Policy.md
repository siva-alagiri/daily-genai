## Acme Corp Email Usage Policy

### Policy Brief & Purpose

This Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp establishes the guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of company email accounts and systems. As a leading Information Technology firm, our email infrastructure is a critical asset for communication, collaboration, and safeguarding proprietary information. This policy aims to ensure professional conduct, protect our digital assets from cyber threats, maintain data integrity, and comply with relevant legal and ethical standards.

### Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties granted access to Acme Corp's email systems, whether individually assigned or departmental. This includes all email accounts ending with `@acmecorp.com` or any other domain officially owned and managed by Acme Corp.

### Components of the Policy

Acme Corp email is a vital communication channel provided for business-related activities. While we offer a degree of flexibility for personal use, all users must prioritize company interests and security.

#### Acceptable Use of Corporate Email

Employees are authorized to use their Acme Corp email for purposes directly related to their job functions and the company's business objectives. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and internal teams.
*   Accessing and registering for professional software, platforms, and services necessary for work.
*   Participating in industry forums, webinars, and professional networking events.
*   Receiving official company communications and updates.

#### Unacceptable Use of Corporate Email

When utilizing Acme Corp email, users are representing the organization. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending, forwarding, or storing content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, defamatory, or illegal.

Limited and reasonable personal use of company email is permitted, provided it does not interfere with job duties, compromise company security, or violate any other aspect of this policy. Examples include:

*   Registering for professional development courses or industry events.
*   Brief communications with family or friends that do not disclose confidential information or constitute spam.
*   Downloading safe and appropriate educational materials or e-books for personal growth.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all email communications on its systems.

#### Email Security

Email remains a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. All users are responsible for maintaining the security of their email accounts and exercising vigilance.

Users must:

*   Create and maintain strong, unique passwords (minimum 12 characters, combining uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) that are not easily guessable and do not contain personal information.
*   Change email passwords every 90 days.
*   Never share their email password with anyone, including IT support.
*   Report any suspicious emails, unauthorized access attempts, or security concerns immediately to the IT Security team.
*   Keep their operating systems and anti-malware software updated on all devices used to access company email.

Users should be highly cautious of emails that:

*   Contain unexpected attachments or links, especially from unknown senders.
*   Have urgent or alarming subject lines (clickbait).
*   Exhibit poor grammar, spelling, or unusual formatting.
*   Request personal information, login credentials, or financial details.
*   Appear to be from a known sender but have a slightly altered email address.

When in doubt about an email's legitimacy, users should contact the sender through an alternative, verified communication channel or consult the IT Security team.

#### Email Signature

All official Acme Corp email communications should include a professional and standardized email signature. This signature helps maintain brand consistency and provides essential contact information.

The standard signature format is:

**[Your Full Name]**
