## Work-From-Home Policy

**Effective Date:** [Insert Current Date, e.g., 15 October 2023]

### 1. Purpose

This Work-From-Home (WFH) Policy at Acme Corp outlines the framework and expectations for employees who are authorized to perform their duties remotely. Our aim is to foster a flexible work environment that supports employee productivity, work-life integration, and business continuity, while upholding our commitment to data security and operational efficiency.

### 2. Eligibility

This policy applies to all full-time and eligible part-time employees of Acme Corp whose roles are deemed suitable for remote work by their department head and Human Resources. Eligibility is determined based on job responsibilities, performance history, and the ability to maintain productivity and collaboration from a remote location. Employees must have successfully completed their probationary period to be considered.

### 3. Approval Process

Employees interested in a WFH arrangement must submit a formal request to their immediate supervisor, outlining the proposed schedule and rationale. The supervisor, in consultation with their department head and Human Resources, will review the request considering team needs, project requirements, and individual performance. Approval is granted at the company's discretion and is subject to periodic review.

### 4. Equipment and Security

Acme Corp will provide necessary company-issued equipment (e.g., laptops, software licenses) required for remote work. Employees are responsible for maintaining a secure and distraction-free home workspace. All remote work must be conducted using company-approved devices and secure network connections (e.g., VPN). Employees are accountable for safeguarding company data and intellectual property, adhering strictly to Acme Corp's cybersecurity protocols.

### 5. Work Hours

Remote employees are expected to maintain their agreed-upon work schedule and be available during core business hours for meetings and collaboration, as defined by their team and manager. Flexibility in daily scheduling may be permitted, provided it does not impact team collaboration or project deadlines. All hours worked must be accurately recorded in the designated time-tracking system.

### 6. Communication

Effective communication is paramount for successful remote work. Employees are required to maintain regular and proactive communication with their supervisors and team members using company-approved tools (e.g., Microsoft Teams, email, video conferencing). Responsiveness to messages and participation in virtual meetings are essential to ensure seamless collaboration.

### 7. Productivity and Performance

Performance expectations for remote employees are consistent with those for in-office employees. Managers will set clear objectives and conduct regular performance reviews to ensure accountability and productivity. Remote work arrangements will be evaluated based on an employee's ability to meet performance targets and contribute effectively to team and company goals.

### 8. Health and Safety

Employees working remotely are responsible for establishing and maintaining a safe, ergonomic, and healthy work environment at their remote location. Acme Corp is not liable for injuries sustained at an employee's remote workspace that are not directly related to work activities or company-provided equipment. Employees should report any work-related incidents or hazards promptly.

### 9. Expenses

Acme Corp will reimburse approved business expenses directly related to remote work, in accordance with the company's expense reimbursement policy. This may include specific software, office supplies, or communication tools, as pre-approved by management. General utility costs (e.g., internet, electricity) are typically the employee's responsibility unless a specific allowance is provided.

### 10. Termination of Remote Work Agreement

Acme Corp reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate any remote work arrangement at its sole discretion, with appropriate notice, based on business needs, changes in job responsibilities, or an employee's performance.

### 11. Confidentiality

All remote employees must strictly adhere to Acme Corp's Confidentiality and Data Protection policies. Unauthorized disclosure, access, or misuse of sensitive company, client, or employee information is strictly prohibited and will result in severe disciplinary action, including termination and potential legal consequences.

### 12. Compliance

Remote employees must comply with all applicable local, state, and national laws and regulations (including those in India), as well as all Acme Corp policies and procedures, while working remotely.

### 13. Acknowledgment
