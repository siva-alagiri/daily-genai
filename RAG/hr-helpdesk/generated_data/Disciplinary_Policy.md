## Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This Company Email Usage Policy at Acme Corp establishes the guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of corporate email accounts by all personnel. As a leading Information Technology firm with a global presence, email is a critical communication channel for our operations, client interactions, and internal collaboration. This policy aims to safeguard Acme Corp's confidential information, maintain our professional reputation, ensure compliance with data protection standards, and protect our technological infrastructure from threats.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third-party personnel who are assigned or granted access to Acme Corp's email systems and services, whether individually or as part of a department. This includes access via company-issued devices or personal devices used for work purposes.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp's email system is a powerful tool provided to facilitate business operations. While primarily intended for professional use, we acknowledge the need for reasonable personal use within defined boundaries.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees of Acme Corp are authorized to use their company email accounts for legitimate business purposes, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and internal teams regarding work-related matters.
*   Registering for industry-relevant webinars, conferences, and professional development platforms.
*   Facilitating official company communications, announcements, and project collaborations.
*   Engaging in professional networking activities that benefit Acme Corp.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When utilizing Acme Corp's email, employees act as representatives of the company. Therefore, they must not:

*   Transmit or store any content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or illegal.
*   Register for or subscribe to services that are competitive with Acme Corp's business, unless explicitly authorized by senior management.
*   Engage in unsolicited mass emailing (spam) or chain letters, especially to internal or external contacts.
*   Access, sign up for, or promote unreliable, illicit, or disreputable websites or services.
*   Disclose confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company, client, or employee information without proper authorization.
*   Use email for extensive personal activities that interfere with job performance or consume excessive company resources.
*   Impersonate another individual or misrepresent their authority.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all email communications and usage for compliance with this policy and to ensure the security and integrity of its systems.

**Personal Use**

Employees are permitted limited and reasonable personal use of their corporate email accounts, provided it does not:

*   Violate any other company policies, including those on harassment or acceptable use.
*   Interfere with job duties or productivity.
*   Incur significant costs or liabilities for Acme Corp.
*   Examples include occasional communication with family or friends, or registration for personal development courses.

**Email Security**

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Protecting our email system is paramount to maintaining our operational integrity and data security. Employees must:

*   Establish strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoiding easily guessable personal information.
*   Change email passwords regularly, as per IT security guidelines (e.g., every 90 days).
*   Be vigilant against suspicious emails, phishing attempts, and social engineering tactics.
*   Refrain from opening attachments or clicking on links from unknown or untrusted senders, or when the content seems unusual or unexpected.
*   Verify the legitimacy of senders and look for red flags such as grammatical errors, unusual formatting, or urgent requests for sensitive information.
*   Report any suspicious emails or potential security incidents immediately to the IT Security department.
*   Ensure that company-issued devices used for email access have up-to-date anti-malware and security software.

**Email Signature**

All professional email communications should include a standardized signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand and professionalism. Employees are encouraged to use the approved company signature template, which typically includes:

*   Employee's Full Name
*   Job Title
*   Department
*   Acme Corp (with official company website link)
*   Company Phone Number (optional)
*   Company Address (optional)

Images, company logos, or links to work-related professional profiles may be included if they adhere to company branding guidelines. Employees can consult their manager or the Marketing department for assistance with signature setup.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**
