# Work-From-Home Policy

**Effective Date:** October 26, 2023

## 1. Purpose

This Work-From-Home (WFH) Policy at Acme Corp establishes a structured framework for employees to perform their duties remotely. It aims to foster a flexible work environment that supports employee well-being, enhances productivity, and ensures business continuity, while maintaining the highest standards of data security and operational efficiency for our 10,000-strong Information Technology workforce.

## 2. Eligibility

This policy applies to all permanent full-time employees of Acme Corp whose roles are deemed suitable for remote work by their department head and Human Resources. Eligibility is determined based on job responsibilities, performance history, and the ability to maintain required productivity and collaboration levels from a non-office location.

## 3. Approval Process

Employees interested in a WFH arrangement must submit a formal request to their immediate supervisor, outlining the proposed schedule and rationale. All requests require approval from both the department head and Human Resources, considering business needs, team dynamics, and individual performance metrics. Approval is granted on a case-by-case basis and is not guaranteed.

## 4. Equipment and Security

Acme Corp will provide necessary company-issued equipment (e.g., laptops, secure access tokens) to facilitate remote work. Employees are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of all company data and intellectual property, adhering strictly to Acme Corp's Cybersecurity and Data Protection policies. A secure, private internet connection is mandatory for all remote work.

## 5. Work Hours

Remote employees are expected to maintain their standard working hours as agreed with their supervisor, ensuring availability during core business hours for collaboration and meetings. Any deviation from standard hours, including overtime, must be pre-approved by the supervisor in accordance with applicable Indian labor laws and company policy.

## 6. Communication

Maintaining effective communication is paramount for remote teams. Employees are required to utilize company-approved communication platforms (e.g., Microsoft Teams, internal email) for all work-related interactions and to respond promptly to communications during working hours. Regular check-ins with supervisors and team members are expected.

## 7. Productivity and Performance

Performance expectations for remote employees are consistent with those for in-office employees. Supervisors will conduct regular performance reviews and provide feedback to ensure accountability and sustained productivity. Remote work arrangements will be periodically assessed to ensure they continue to meet performance objectives.

## 8. Health and Safety

Employees working remotely are responsible for establishing and maintaining a safe, ergonomic, and distraction-free workspace at their remote location. Acme Corp is not liable for injuries sustained in an employee's remote workspace that are not directly related to work activities or company-provided equipment.

## 9. Expenses

Acme Corp will reimburse employees for pre-approved, reasonable business expenses directly incurred due to remote work, in line with the company's Employee Business Expense Policy. Personal expenses are not reimbursable.

## 10. Termination of Remote Work Agreement

Acme Corp reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate any remote work arrangement at its sole discretion, with appropriate notice, based on business needs, performance concerns, or changes in company policy.

## 11. Confidentiality

All remote employees must strictly adhere to Acme Corp's Confidentiality and Data Protection policies. Unauthorized disclosure or misuse of sensitive company, client, or employee information will result in severe disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and legal proceedings.

## 12. Compliance

Employees participating in the WFH program must comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations in India, as well as all Acme Corp policies and procedures, while working remotely.

## 13. Acknowledgment

By participating in the Work-From-Home program, employees acknowledge their understanding and agreement to comply with all terms and conditions outlined in this policy.

## 14. Review and Updates

This policy will be reviewed periodically, at least annually, and updated as necessary to ensure its continued effectiveness and alignment with business requirements and regulatory changes. Employees will be informed of any revisions.
