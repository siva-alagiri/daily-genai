## Acme Corp Email Usage Policy

### POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE

The Acme Corp Email Usage Policy establishes the guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of corporate email accounts by all personnel. As a leading Information Technology company, email is a critical communication channel and a repository of valuable information. This policy aims to ensure that email is utilized professionally, protects sensitive company data, maintains our brand reputation, and complies with all relevant Indian data protection laws and company security standards.

### SCOPE

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties granted access to or assigned an official Acme Corp email address, whether for individual or departmental use. This includes access from company-issued devices or personal devices.

### COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY

Acme Corp email accounts are provided as essential tools for business communication and collaboration. While we offer a degree of flexibility for personal use, all users must adhere to the principles of professionalism, security, and data integrity.

#### Correct Use of Corporate Email

Acme Corp employees are authorized to use their company email for all legitimate business-related activities, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, vendors, and internal teams regarding projects, operations, and company business.
*   Accessing and utilizing authorized software, platforms, and services necessary for job functions.
*   Engaging in professional networking, industry forums, and educational resources that support professional development and company objectives.
*   Receiving official company communications, updates, and notifications.

#### Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email

When using an Acme Corp email address, users are representing the company. Therefore, the following actions are strictly prohibited:

*   Sending, forwarding, or storing content that is discriminatory, harassing, offensive, or illegal under Indian law.
*   Registering for or participating in activities related to unauthorized competitive services or businesses.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Signing up for unreliable, illegal, or disreputable websites, services, or mailing lists.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information without explicit authorization.
*   Engaging in any activity that could compromise Acme Corp's reputation, legal standing, or technical infrastructure.

#### Personal Use

Employees are permitted reasonable personal use of their corporate email, provided it does not interfere with job duties, compromise company security, or violate any other company policies. Examples of acceptable personal use include:

*   Registering for personal development courses, workshops, or professional community events.
*   Sending brief, non-disruptive communications to friends and family.
*   Subscribing to safe and appropriate newsletters, e-books, or content for personal interest.

All personal use must adhere to the company's confidentiality and data protection policies.

#### Email Security

Email is a primary vector for cyber threats such as phishing, malware, and data breaches. Protecting our email system is paramount to safeguarding company and client data. All users must:

*   **Password Strength:** Create and maintain strong, unique passwords of at least eight characters, incorporating a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information (e.g., birthdays, names).
*   **Password Management:** Change email passwords every 90 days. Do not reuse previous passwords.
*   **Phishing Awareness:** Exercise extreme caution with suspicious emails. Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown or unverified senders. Verify sender identity, check for grammatical errors, unusual formatting, or urgent requests for information.
*   **Malware Protection:** Ensure all company-issued devices have up-to-date anti-malware and antivirus software.
*   **Reporting:** Immediately report any suspicious emails, potential security incidents, or unauthorized access attempts to the IT Security team.
*   **Confidentiality:** Never share email account credentials with anyone, including colleagues or IT personnel.

#### Email Signature

All official outgoing emails should include a standardized professional signature that reflects Acme Corp's brand identity. This typically includes:

*   Employee's Full Name
*   Job Title
*   Acme Corp (with official company website link)
*   Official Company Phone Number (if applicable)
*   Company Address

Employees may include company logos or approved work-related links/videos. Guidance on creating and maintaining signatures can be obtained from the Marketing or IT department.

### DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES

Violation of this Email Usage Policy will result in disciplinary action, which may include, but is not limited to, verbal warnings, written reprimands, suspension, and termination of employment. Severe breaches, particularly those involving unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, illegal activities, or significant harm to Acme Corp, may also lead to legal action. Each incident will be investigated thoroughly and handled on a case-by-case basis.
