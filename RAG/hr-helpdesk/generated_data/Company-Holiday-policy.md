## Acme Corp Cyber Security Policy

**Policy brief & purpose**

Our Acme Corp Cyber Security Policy outlines the comprehensive guidelines and provisions for safeguarding our digital assets and technology infrastructure. As a leading Information Technology firm, we recognize that robust cybersecurity is paramount to protecting our proprietary information, client data, and operational continuity. Human errors, sophisticated cyber threats, and system vulnerabilities pose significant risks that could lead to financial losses, reputational damage, and legal liabilities. This policy establishes a framework of security measures and clear instructions to mitigate these risks and foster a security-conscious culture.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, interns, and any third parties who have permanent or temporary access to our systems, networks, data, or hardware, regardless of their location or device ownership.

**Policy elements**

**Confidential Data**

Confidential data at Acme Corp is defined as any information that is secret, valuable, and not intended for public disclosure. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Proprietary software code, algorithms, and intellectual property.
*   Client data, including personally identifiable information (PII), financial records, and project specifications.
*   Unpublished financial results, business strategies, and market research.
*   Employee personal data and human resources records.
*   Security protocols, network configurations, and system vulnerabilities.

All individuals covered by this policy are obligated to protect this data with the highest level of care.

**Protect Personal and Company Devices**

Devices used to access Acme Corp resources, whether company-issued or personal (BYOD), introduce potential security risks. All users must ensure their devices (laptops, desktops, tablets, smartphones) are secure by:

*   Enabling strong, unique password or biometric protection for all devices.
*   Installing and regularly updating approved antivirus/anti-malware software.
*   Ensuring operating systems and applications are patched with the latest security updates promptly.
*   Never leaving devices unattended or unsecured in public or shared spaces.
*   Accessing company accounts and systems only through secure, encrypted networks (e.g., corporate VPN, trusted home networks). Public Wi-Fi should be avoided for sensitive company data unless a secure VPN is actively used.
*   Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all company accounts where available.
*   Reporting lost or stolen devices immediately to the IT Security team.

New hires receiving company-issued equipment will be provided with instructions for:
*   Disk encryption setup.
*   Password management tool configuration.
*   Installation and configuration of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) software.

**Keep Emails Safe**

Emails are a primary vector for phishing, malware, and social engineering attacks. To prevent security incidents, all users must:

*   Exercise extreme caution with unsolicited emails, especially those containing attachments or links. Do not open them if the sender is unknown or the content seems suspicious.
*   Be wary of urgent or unusual requests, even if they appear to come from a known colleague or executive. Always verify such requests through an alternative, secure communication channel.
*   Check sender email addresses for subtle misspellings or inconsistencies.
*   Look for grammatical errors, unusual formatting, or generic greetings that often indicate a phishing attempt.
*   Report any suspicious emails to the IT Security team immediately using the designated reporting mechanism.

**Manage Passwords Properly**

Weak or compromised passwords are a significant security vulnerability. All users must adhere to Acme Corp's password policy:

*   Create strong, unique passwords of at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
*   Avoid using personal information (birthdays, names) or easily guessable sequences.
*   Never share passwords with anyone, including colleagues or IT support.
*   Utilize the company-provided password manager for storing and generating complex passwords.
*   Change passwords for critical systems every 90 days.
*   Enable MFA on all accounts that support it.

**Transfer Data Securely**

Secure data transfer is critical to prevent unauthorized access and breaches. Users must:

*   Avoid transferring sensitive data (e.g., client PII, proprietary code) to personal devices or unauthorized cloud storage services.
*   Use only approved, encrypted company channels (e.g., secure file transfer protocols, corporate cloud storage with access controls) for sharing confidential information.
*   Verify that recipients of data are authorized and have appropriate security measures in place.
*   Never transmit confidential data over unencrypted public networks.

**Report Scams, Privacy Breaches, and Hacking Attempts**

Prompt reporting is essential for effective incident response. All users must:

*   Report any perceived cyberattacks, suspicious activities, privacy breaches, or phishing attempts to the IT Security team immediately.
*   Provide as much detail as possible about the incident, including screenshots or relevant communication.
*   The IT Security team will investigate all reports promptly, resolve issues, and issue company-wide alerts when necessary.

**Additional Measures**

To further enhance our cybersecurity posture:

**Employee Responsibilities:**
*   Always lock your computer screen when stepping away from your desk.
*   Report any stolen or damaged equipment to HR and the IT Security team as soon as possible.
*   Change all account passwords immediately if a device is stolen or compromised.
*   Refrain from downloading or installing unauthorized, suspicious, or illegal software on company equipment.
*   Avoid accessing suspicious or unapproved websites.

**IT Security Team Responsibilities:**
*   Implement and maintain robust firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions.
*   Conduct regular security audits, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing.
*   Provide mandatory security awareness training to all employees annually and upon onboarding.
*   Keep employees informed about emerging threats, new scam tactics, and best practices for digital hygiene.
*   Ensure compliance with all relevant data protection laws and industry standards (e.g., GDPR, ISO 27001, Indian IT Act).
*   Manage and monitor access controls to sensitive systems and data.

**Remote Employees**

Remote employees must adhere to all aspects of this policy. Additionally, they are required to:

*   Ensure their home network is secured with a strong password and up-to-date router firmware.
*   Use the company-provided Virtual Private Network (VPN) for all access to internal company resources.
*   Maintain a dedicated and secure workspace free from unauthorized access.
*   Ensure all company-issued devices used for remote work are encrypted.

**Disciplinary Action**

Acme Corp takes cybersecurity seriously. Any violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

*   **First-time, unintentional, minor security breach:** May result in a verbal warning and mandatory retraining on security protocols.
*   **Intentional, repeated, or large-scale breaches (causing significant financial, reputational, or data damage):** Will lead to severe disciplinary action, including immediate termination and potential legal action.

Employees observed disregarding security instructions, even if no breach occurs, will face progressive discipline. Each incident will be examined on a case-by-case basis, considering intent, impact, and prior history.
