## Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

This policy outlines the guidelines for the appropriate and secure use of corporate email addresses and systems at Acme Corp. As a leading Information Technology company, maintaining professional communication standards, safeguarding sensitive data, and upholding our corporate reputation are paramount. This policy aims to ensure that all email usage aligns with our company values, legal obligations, and security protocols.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all Acme Corp employees, contractors, consultants, and any third parties granted access to our corporate email systems, whether individual or departmental accounts, regardless of location or device used.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp's email system is a vital business communication asset. While primarily intended for professional use, limited personal use is permitted within defined boundaries that do not compromise company resources, security, or productivity.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are authorized to use corporate email for all legitimate business communications and activities, including but not limited to:

*   Communicating with clients, partners, and colleagues on work-related matters.
*   Accessing and utilizing company-approved software and online services essential for job functions.
*   Professional networking and correspondence at industry events or conferences.
*   Receiving work-related newsletters, updates, and educational content.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

When using corporate email, employees represent Acme Corp. Therefore, employees must not use corporate email for:

*   Sending or forwarding offensive, discriminatory, harassing, or defamatory content.
*   Unauthorized registration for services or platforms that compete with Acme Corp's business interests.
*   Intentionally sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) to internal or external recipients.
*   Accessing, distributing, or promoting illegal, unreliable, or inappropriate websites or services.
*   Engaging in unlawful marketing, solicitation, or political campaigning.
*   Disclosing confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information without explicit authorization.

**Personal Use**

Limited personal use of corporate email is permitted, provided it:

*   Does not interfere with work duties or productivity.
*   Does not consume excessive company resources (e.g., storage, bandwidth).
*   Does not violate any other company policies, including those related to data security and confidentiality.
*   Includes brief personal communications or registrations for professional development activities.

**Email Security**

Email security is critical to protecting Acme Corp's intellectual property and client data. Employees are required to:

*   Create and maintain strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, updating them regularly as per IT guidelines.
*   Exercise extreme caution with suspicious emails, unexpected links, and unsolicited attachments, as these are common vectors for malware and phishing attacks.
*   Report any suspected phishing attempts, unusual email activity, or security incidents immediately to the IT Security department.
*   Ensure all company-issued devices used for email access have up-to-date security software and operating system patches.
*   Never share email account credentials with anyone.

**Email Signature**

All external emails sent from an Acme Corp corporate email address must include a standardized professional signature, as defined and provided by the Marketing or IT department, to maintain consistent corporate branding. Personal quotes, unauthorized images, or non-business-related links are prohibited in official signatures.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

Violation of this policy may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, depending on the severity and frequency of the breach. Examples of violations include, but are not limited to:

*   Unauthorized disclosure of confidential, proprietary, or sensitive company information.
*   Sending or distributing inappropriate, offensive, or illegal content.
*   Engaging in activities that compromise the company's network security or reputation.
*   Repeated or intentional misuse of corporate email for personal gain or non-business purposes.
