## Company Email Usage Policy

**POLICY BRIEF AND PURPOSE**

At Acme Corp, digital communication is fundamental to our operations and global connectivity. This policy outlines the responsible and secure use of company email accounts to uphold our professional image, protect sensitive information, and ensure efficient communication across our diverse and extensive workforce. It aims to safeguard Acme Corp's digital assets, maintain regulatory compliance within India, and foster a secure and productive communication environment for all employees.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all individuals granted access to Acme Corp's email system, including permanent employees, contractors, temporary staff, and departmental accounts, regardless of their location or the device used to access company email.

**COMPONENTS OF THE POLICY**

Acme Corp email is a primary channel for official business communications, facilitating collaboration and information exchange critical to our success.

**Correct Use of Corporate Email**

Employees are authorized to use their assigned Acme Corp email accounts for:
*   Client interactions, project discussions, and official correspondence.
*   Internal team collaboration, departmental communications, and cross-functional project management.
*   Professional networking and engagement with industry partners that directly benefits Acme Corp's business objectives.
*   Accessing company-approved software, platforms, and resources necessary for job functions.

**Inappropriate Use of Corporate Email**

Employees must not use company email for transmitting content that is discriminatory, harassing, or violates any Acme Corp policies or Indian legal statutes. Prohibited uses include, but are not limited to:
*   Sharing proprietary information, intellectual property, or confidential data without explicit authorization.
*   Engaging in political campaigning, religious proselytization, or any activity unrelated to Acme Corp's business.
*   Subscribing to unreliable, illegal, or disreputable online services that could compromise company data or reputation.
*   Sending unsolicited bulk emails (spam) or chain letters.
*   Creating or forwarding content that is offensive, defamatory, or sexually explicit.

Acme Corp reserves the right to monitor all corporate email communications for compliance with this policy and to protect its legitimate business interests.

**Personal Use**

While limited personal use of company email is permitted, it must not:
*   Interfere with work duties or productivity.
*   Consume excessive company resources (e.g., storage, bandwidth).
*   Compromise Acme Corp's security protocols or reputation.
*   Violate any other company policies or legal requirements.

Employees may use their accounts for essential personal communications or registrations that do not conflict with Acme Corp's interests or policies, provided such use is minimal and infrequent.

**Email Security**

Given the critical nature of digital assets in an IT firm, robust email security is paramount. Employees are mandated to:
*   Set strong, unique passwords for their email accounts, adhering to Acme Corp's password complexity guidelines (minimum 12 characters, combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).
*   Enable and utilize multi-factor authentication (MFA) as required by IT Security.
*   Exercise extreme caution with suspicious emails, attachments, or links (phishing attempts).
*   Promptly report any suspected phishing attempts, unusual email activity, or security breaches to the IT Security team.
*   Keep anti-malware and operating system software updated on all devices used to access company email.
*   Avoid accessing company email on unsecured public Wi-Fi networks or untrusted devices.

Regular security awareness training is compulsory for all employees.

**Email Signature**

A standardized professional email signature is required for all external communications to maintain brand consistency and professionalism. This signature should include:
*   Employee's Full Name
*   Job Title
*   Department
*   Acme Corp (with official company link)
*   Official Company Phone Number (if applicable)
*   Company Address

Templates and guidelines for email signatures will be provided by the Marketing department and must be adhered to without modification.

**DISCIPLINARY CONSEQUENCES**

All disciplinary actions will align with Acme Corp's Disciplinary Policy and applicable Indian labor laws.
